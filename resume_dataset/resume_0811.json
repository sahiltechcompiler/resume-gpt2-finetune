        "description": "Collected data from 100+ top ranked private institutions (NIRF) spanning two academic years (2021-2022) to identify year-over-year (YoY) variations in placement percentages across 8 major engineering branches. Applied classical statistical methods to analyze the relationship between placements and factors such as university reputation, student performance metrics, branch specialization, resulting in a 25% increase in the accuracy of predictions. Utilized Python libraries (Pandas & NumPy) for data wrangling and collection; Created 45+ informative visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn enhancing data comprehension. Employed machine learning model using random forest algorithm with accuracy of 89% to predict placement success and to evaluate its accuracy in forecasting outcomes. Conducted a survey of 50+ recruiters and HR professionals from leading Indian companies to understand their perspectives on key qualities and skills sought when recruiting engineering graduates.",

Developed and implemented logistic regression model with an accuracy rate of 79% & XGBOOST to build high-performance models, achieving an 84% accuracy rate. Conducted hyperparameter tuning on machine learning models, which increased model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) by an average of 10%. Implemented EDA techniques to identify key patterns and trends, reducing preprocessing time by 15% and increasing feature relevance, which led to a 10% boost in model accuracy. Conducted feature engineering on 15+ variables, increasing the interpretability of models and visualized data trends and insights using Power-BI & Stream lite.",
