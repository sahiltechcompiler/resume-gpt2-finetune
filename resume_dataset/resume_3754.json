        "description": "Used to segregate the queries given by users between different intents and give the perfect matched intent query remark for it. Python plays a very critical role to encapsulate the data from the excel using the openpyxl for better performance. Used a Sentence Transformer and a similarity threshold which would help in lemmatization of sentences and using cosine scores to compare between sentences for the semantic meaning was done. Was able to learn the usage of spacy model for sentence transforming and achieved a accuracy of 85%.",
