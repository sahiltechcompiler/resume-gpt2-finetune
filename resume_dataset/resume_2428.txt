PROJECTS Customer Attrition Rate Prediction in Telecom using Machine Learning and Deep Learning College Project  github.com/aviral022/Attrition-Rate-Prediction-in-Telecommunication.git  December 2023 - March 2024   Developed predictive models using machine learning and deep learning techniques to forecast attrition rates in the telecom industry. Conducted thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering to extract insights from large datasets, enhancing model performance.  Implemented various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM) and deep learning architectures (e.g., RNNs, CNNs) for accurate prediction of customer churn behavior (achieved accuracy 98%).  Presented Paper in Conference organized by Poornima University. Face Recognition github.com/aviral022/Face-Recognition.git  August 2023 - November 2023  Objective: Develop a system that can accurately identify and verify individuals based on facial features captured from images or video.  Components: Utilize computer vision techniques such as Haar Cascades for face detection and recognition; integrate with databases to store and retrieve facial embeddings or features for comparison. Pharmacy Website College Project  January 2022 - April 2022  Launched a comprehensive pharmacy website that processed prescription, integrated with electronic health records (EHR) systems, and enhanced user experience with easy navigation and secure payment options.  Enhanced the pharmacy website's performance by implementing advanced search functionalities EDUCATION B.Tech in Information Technology Minor in Data Analytics  Manipal University Jaipur  Jaipur, Rajasthan, INDIA  2025 12th (CBSE) Springdales Childrens School  Kota, Rajasthan, INDIA  2021 10th (CBSE) Saraswati Vidya Mandir  Sultanpur, UP, INDIA  2019 CERTIFICATIONS Computer Vision 101 Infosys Springboard  2024 Introduction to Deep Learning Infosys Springboard  2024 Introduction to Natural Language Processing Infosys Springboard  2024 Data Science Job Simulation Forage  2023 SKILLS Technical Skills: Python, SQL, C, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Data Wrangling, Natural Language Processing, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Django Soft Skills : Communication (Verbal and Written) , Problem Solving, Critical Thinking ,Teamwork and Collaboration , Time Management, Adaptability, Leadership, Attention to Detail . .
