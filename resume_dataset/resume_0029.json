        "description": "Developed an automated Sudoku solver using Java and created an interactive Sudoku board using JavaScript to visualize the solving process. Implemented a backtracking algorithm in Java to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels. Ensured the solver adhered to Sudoku rules by incorporating constraints to prevent duplicate numbers in rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids. Optimized the Java code to enhance performance and reduce solution time for complex puzzles. Integrated the Java solver with the JavaScript board for seamless user interaction.",
