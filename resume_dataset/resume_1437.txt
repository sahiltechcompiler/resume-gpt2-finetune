Technology Used : Python , Machine Learning, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB. Diabetes Prediction System Based on predictive modeling predicts the disease of the user based on the symptoms that user provides as an input 11/2022 - 12/2022  The model analyses the symptoms and relevant parameters provided by the user and gives the probability that the user has the disease as an output.  Accuracy ranging between 73% and 76% depending upon the algorithm used for the model.  Technology Used: Python, Machine Learning Colour Detection Model A Computer Vision model which can predict the precise colour along with its RGB values in any given image. 12/2021 - 01/2022  Used Computer Vision technology to build a model which can be deployed in AI applications such as self driving cars,object detection,etc.  Technology Used: Python, Computer Vision, OpenCV Technical Skills  Python  Data Analysis Learning  Data Structures  Computer Vision  Data Mining  NumPy  Predictive Modeling  Pandas  Seaborn  Object Oriented Programming  Matplotlib  DBMS  Web Scraping  Machine Certifications Unsupervised Learning,Recommenders,Reinforcement Learning by DeepLearning.ai on Coursera08/2023 - 10/2023 Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification by DeepLearning.ai on Coursera07/2023 - 08/2023 IBM Data Science by IBM on Coursera Data Structures and Algorithms - Part 2 - Infosys Springboard 12/2022 - 06/2023 10/2022 - 11/2022 Data Structures and Algorithms using Python - Part 1 - Infosys Springboard 09/2022 - 10/2022 Python (Basic) Certification by HackerRank Python Basics by University of Michigan on Coursera 01/2022 - 01/2022 06/2021 - 07/2021
