        "description": "Implemented CNN models for indoor localization, achieving sub-meter accuracy with a median error of 0.8m and 80% of predictions within 1.2m. Developed CNN architecture with three convolutional layers, 3x3 filters, and dropout techniques to prevent overfitting, ensuring robust model training. Demonstrated a validation accuracy of 94.6667%, underscoring the reliability and effectiveness of the developed CNN model for indoor localization tasks. Optimized CNN performance by analyzing antenna arrangement, channel bandwidth, and training data volume, improving localization accuracy. Conducted analysis on various factors affecting CNN performance, resulting in a 12% improvement in localization accuracy compared to existing methods.",
