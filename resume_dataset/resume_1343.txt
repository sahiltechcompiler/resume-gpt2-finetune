Chabbil Das Public School (Ghaziabad) Secondary JKG School (Ghaziabad) 2021 - Prersuing 2020 - 2021 2018 - 2019 PROJECTS CyberSecurity Based Phishing Detection (https://github.com/RONITrrt/cat-phish) Developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and TensorFlow. Identifies phishing domains through URL analysis and screenshot-based detection. Integrates with email inboxes to detect phishing attempts. Accident Severity Detection System and Alert Mechanism Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify accident severity from CCTV footage. Automatically generates SOS alerts to the nearest hospitals based on severity level. Built with real-time detection and integration for emergency response systems. CrossBorder Transaction through Cryptography (https://github.com/RONITrrt/CrossCoin) Developed a custom cryptocurrency named Cross-Coin for secure transactions. Implemented encryption algorithms for secure cross-border transactions. Built a web platform for users to perform and monitor cryptocurrency transactions. Drowsiness Detection and Alarming System (https://github.com/RONITrrt/Drowsiness) Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow for drowsiness detection. Integrated OpenCV for real-time video analysis of driver alertness. System triggers a loud alarm when drowsiness is detected, with 98% model accuracy.
