        "description": "This project explores the potential of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to enhance fraud detection in the credit card domain. It utilizes a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for classifying fraudulent transactions. By incorporating SHAP for feature selection, the project achieved a significant 3% boost in the KNN model's precision compared to a model that employed all features. This improvement highlights SHAP's ability to pinpoint the most critical features for fraud identification, leading to a more precise KNN model. It's important to consider that SHAP's applicability extends beyond KNN models. It has the potential to improve the precision or recall of various other machine learning models employed in credit card fraud detection tasks.",

        "description": "This project tackles plant pathogen classification with a transfer learning approach that emphasizes efficiency. A pre-trained ResNet-50, fine-tuned on a general image dataset, extracts informative features from plant images. These features are then fed into a smaller neural network specifically trained to identify different plant pathogens on a separate dataset. This two-step method achieves comparable performance to directly fine-tuning a new ResNet-50 on the pathogen dataset, suggesting a potentially more efficient strategy by reducing the overall training complexity.",
