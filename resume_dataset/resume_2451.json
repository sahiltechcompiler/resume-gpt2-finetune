        "description": "Developed a full-stack CRUD application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack to facilitate tracking of daily workouts and exercises. Implemented user authentication and authorization functionalities using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access to user-specific data and features. Designed and developed RESTful APIs with Express.js to handle HTTP requests and interact with the MongoDB database for storing and retrieving workout data. Implemented comprehensive error handling and validation mechanisms to enhance application robustness and provide users with informative feedback on input validation and error resolution.",

Implemented facial recognition algorithms to match user identities with their driving license photos stored in a database. Generated real-time parking access passes upon successful verification, allowing authorized users seamless entry and exit. Implemented YOLOv4, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to accurately detect and localize vehicle license plates in real-time video streams.",
