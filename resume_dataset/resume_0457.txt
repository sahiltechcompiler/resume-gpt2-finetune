SIDDHARTH KUMAR JHA + 91 9625793314 Sidjha1454@gmail.com SiddharthJha04 Sidhujha Siddharth-kiet EXPERIENCE CodeClause June 2024-July 2024 Data Science Intern Off-site   Immersed myself in a stimulating learning environment at CodeClause, where I gained hands-on experience, throughout the internship, I was given two challenging real-world projects. These projects pushed me to enhance my technical skills. Each task presented unique challenges, giving me valuable insights into Data Science and its practical use in the software industry. Tasks are Customer Lifetime Value Prediction and House Price Prediction System. PROJECTS   Anti-Spoofing/Liveness Detection | Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow, OS, Ultralytics, Flask December, 2023 Implemented real-time liveness detection to distinguish between real users and spoofed attempts using videos and images. It helps to enhance security in facial recognition systems. 25% improvement in authentication accuracy 30% reduction in false acceptance rates. Utilized multiple techniques for liveness detection: Blink detection, Head movement analysis, Texture analysis, These methods increased the system's robustness by 20%. House Price Prediction System | Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Flask May, 2024  Developed a house price prediction system to provide accurate real estate valuations. 20% increase in prediction accuracy  and 15% reduction in mean absolute error. Implement Linear Regression model to analyze various factors influencing house prices such as Location, Property size and Number of bedrooms and bathrooms. These features enhanced the model's predictive power by 25%. 2D Face Recognition System | Python, OpenCV, dlib, OS, PIL, Sklearn, Flask, CNN June, 2023 It enhance security and streamline identity verification processes. 30% increase in recognition accuracy and 20% reduction in processing time.   Utilized multiple stages for face recognition: Face detection, Face alignment, Feature extraction and Face matching. These stages improved the system's reliability by 25%. CERTIFICATES Cloud Foundations | Amazon Web Services (AWS) May, 2024 Become a Data Analyst | Linkedin May, 2024 Networking Essentials | Cisco Networking Academy May, 2024 Problem Solving in DSA and Fundamentals of Web Development | Programming Pathshala May, 2024 Python Programming | CodSoft May, 2024 AI Using Python | Ducat, Certificate No.  31122022884288040 October, 2023 EDUCATION KIET GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS 2021  2025 B.Tech. in Information Technology Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh CH.
