For: Niharika Jain, Founder, Broomees Date: 12th August 2024 Dear Selection Committee, I am writing to wholeheartedly recommend Broomees for the Development Bank of Singapore's grant. As an advocate for innovative social solutions, I invested my capital and time to Broomees and I have closely observed their impactful work, led by Niharika, to address critical issues in the domestic work sector in India. Broomees is revolutionizing the lives of domestic workers by providing them with dignied employment opportunities, fair wages, and essential benets. The organization has signicantly increased the salaries of domestic workers through their platform and goes beyond nancial support by oering health insurance, interest-free loans, female hygiene products, and transportation assistance, which greatly enhance workers' quality of life. The company's training programs in cooking, cleaning, and babysitting address the gap left by conventional education, equipping workers with valuable skills and improving their professional prospects. This approach not only uplifts individual workers but also meets the needs of customers seeking reliable and professional domestic help. Under Niharikas leadership, Broomees has demonstrated a commitment to social impact and operational excellence. Their work is not only transforming the domestic work sector but also setting a precedent for how businesses can drive systemic change. I strongly support Broomees application for your grant and believe that your support will enable them to expand their reach and amplify their positive impact. Broomees is an exemplary organization deserving of your investment and trust. Thank you for considering this recommendation. Please feel free to contact me for any further information or clarication.
