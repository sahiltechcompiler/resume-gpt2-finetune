Collaborated with professor to gain proficiency in machine learning methods: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Naive Bayes Classifiers, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).  Implemented SVM and ANN models on 5 medical datasets and developed Ensemble methods (Boosting and Bagging) project-collab Projects 1. Predictive Health Care System | Web and Machine Learning website, git  Utilized technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, MongoDB, Flask, and Python.  Developed a full-stack web application to predict patient disease based on symptoms given.  Applied six machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate one for disease prediction.  Features: doctor availability, medicine suggestions, hospital locations based on disease. 2. Spam Messages Classifier | Streamlit Python website, git  Developed a website leveraging a pre-trained machine learning model to distinguish between spam and genuine messages.  Integrated the ML model with the Streamlit library in Python to create an interactive frontend interface. 3.
