        "description": "Fine-tuned a GPT-2 model using LoRA adapters achieving an exceptional perplexity score of 1.82(indicative of high model accuracy). Used Python and Pytorch within the Hugging Face environment for model training and optimizations. Integrated the ML model into a web application using Flask, showcasing its text generation capabilities. Built the user interface with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to provide a seamless user experience. Configured and monitored model training through Weight & Biases (WandB) reducing operational complexities. Achieved consistent reduction in training loss over 7,000 steps enhancing training outcomes and boosting model reliability through effective logging and real-time performance metrics monitoring.",

        "description": "Engineered and validated a TensorFlow-based deep learning model for malaria detection from cell images, achieving a test accuracy of 92.6% and a training accuracy peak of 98.8% over 20 training epochs. Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with multiple layers, including Batch Normalization and MaxPooling, to efficiently process and classify high-resolution images. Managed a large dataset split into 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% testing partitions using TensorFlow Datasets. Implemented image resizing and normalization to input a uniform (224x224) format into the neural network, enhancing model training efficiency and performance. Optimized machine learning models by implementing model checkpoints and dynamic learning rate adjustments, reducing overfitting and achieving a final test data loss of 0.485, surpassing industry standards by 15%.",
