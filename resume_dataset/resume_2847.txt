Work involved defining and using various metrics to monitor the performance of the Jump Start Solutions page developed by the Solutions Catalog team. The metrics were defined using Streamz library in JAVA and monitored using Monarch instrumentation and queried with the help of Mash query language. The results obtained through the metrics were visualized in the form of graphs with the help of Automon dashboards. Google India STEP Intern MAY 2022-JULY 2022 Worked as a STEP intern in Google India with the Google Cloud team. Work involved creating a dashboard to track and analyze the tests running internally in different workstreams within the Anthos team of Google Cloud. The dashboard was developed by importing test result data(stored in protocol buffer format), and then querying the data(using GoogleSQL commands) to extract the required information. After extraction, the obtained results were displayed in a user interface built with PLX technology using HTML and CSS elements. Commtail Maxima, New Delhi  Intern JULY 2021-AUGUST 2021 Worked as a content writing intern in this Delhi-based company. Articles were written on a wide range of technical topics such as Basics of Coding, Python, and Various Operations using Python. Parivartan(NGO), Siwan  Volunteer OCTOBER 2017 Volunteer work in the rural area of Siwan, Bihar, as part of The Rural Immersion Programme, organized by DPS, Patna. PROJECTS Student Attendance and Performance Recording System  Machine Learning Developed as part of Hackfest22 organized by IIT(ISM) Dhanbad. Development of an attendance recording model along with a performance detection model using machine learning. The attendance model analyzed faces using webcam input and stored the attendance. The performance detection model contained an eye detection model and an emotion detection model. The eye-detection model analyzed whether the eyes of a student were open or closed while the emotion-detection model analyzed the emotions of a student during a particular class. The entire project was made using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras Library.
