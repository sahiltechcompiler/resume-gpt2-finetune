Developed and implemented logistic regression model with an accuracy rate of 79% & XGBOOST to build high-performance    models, achieving an 84% accuracy rate Conducted hyperparameter tuning on machine learning models, which increased model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) by an average of 10%. Implemented EDA techniques to identify key patterns and trends, reducing preprocessing time by 15% and increasing feature relevance, which led to a 10% boost in model accuracy. Conducted feature engineering on 15+ variables, increasing the interpretability of models and visualized data trends and insights using Power-BI & Stream lite PROJECT DETAILS Analyzing trends and patterns in placements of engineering students JAN 2024  APRIL 2024 Objectives:   Collected data from 100+ top ranked private institutions (NIRF) spanning two academic years (2021-2022) to identify year- over-year (YoY) variations in placement percentages across 8 major engineering branches Applied classical statistical methods to analyze the relationship between placements and factors such as university reputation, student performance metrics, branch specialization, resulting in a 25% increase in the accuracy of predictions.  Utilized Python libraries (Pandas & NumPy) for data wrangling and collection; Created 45+ informative visualizations using   Matplotlib & Seaborn enhancing data comprehension Employed machine learning model using random forest algorithm with accuracy of 89% to predict placement success and to evaluate its accuracy in forecasting outcomes Conducted a survey of 50+ recruiters and HR professionals from leading Indian companies to understand their perspectives on key qualities and skills sought when recruiting engineering graduates ACHIEVEMENTS & POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY       2024: Secured 4th/110 Teams, Magnate Case Competition 2.0 at Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) 2024: President of Manipals branch of 180 Degrees Consulting, worlds largest university-based consultancy for NGOs 2024: Ranked among Top 10 Teams, Eximius 2024, National case study competition, Symbiosis Bengaluru 2023: Secured 1st Position in ELICIT 2022 Hackathon by ACM MUJ 2022: Finalists 7th/80 teams, Sri Guru Gobind Singh College of Commerce Case-Study Competition 2022 2022: Volunteered at Guzaarish, a New-Delhi based NGO SKILLS    Languages: Python, SQL, VBA, HTML, CSS Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn Software: Power-BI, Microsoft Excel, Git/GitHub, VSCode, PowerPoint, Think Cell, Google Colab CERTIFICATIONS     2024: Certification in Google Data Analytics Professional, Coursera 2023: Certification in Share Data Through the Art of Visualization, Coursera 2022: Certification in Agile Methodology Virtual Experience Program, Cognizant, Forage 2021: Certification in Microeconomics: When Market Fail, Penn University of Pennsylvania, Coursera
