Dataset was split into 35 training images and 15 testing images. YOLOv8 was employed for its real-time object detection capabilities, and OpenCV was used for visualizing the results. Trained on 20 epochs, Mean Average Precision (MAP) of 0.79 was achieved.",

Trained over 50 epochs, the model achieves an accuracy of 0.65. VGG16 extracts features from the images, which are then utilized by the RNN to generate descriptive captions. Implementing beam search during prediction ensured more accurate descriptions.",
