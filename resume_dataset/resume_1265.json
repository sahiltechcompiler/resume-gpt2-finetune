These QR codes enable students to conveniently mark their attendance by simply scanning the code. Additionally, the application offers a valuable feature wherein if a student's attendance drops below the 75% threshold, they can raise alerts within the app to notify relevant parties. Furthermore, the system incorporates security measures like device factor authentication and location-based tracking to ensure the integrity of attendance records and enhance overall security.",
