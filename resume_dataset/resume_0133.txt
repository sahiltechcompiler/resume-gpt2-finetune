I am currently pursuing B.Tech, 3rd year, in ECE stream of SRM University AP. This is my CV, gives a brief description of my accom- plishments and work experience . Work Experience Intern June 2023 - Aug 2023 I have worked as an Intern in SIRIUS SOLAR ENERGY, for almost two months. The company had two sessions, Solder session and Leaded assembling session, I have worked in leaded assembling session where all components like resistors, capacitors, transistor.. allSMD devices are mounted on PCB with solder paste manually. After, assembling they are sent to (QC) Quality Checker, where in this session all PCB Boards are tested and checked and, if any PCB is damaged or misplaced any component, it will replaced with new one... Projects Crime Pattern Analysis It is Developed to make crime prediction using features present in dataset(extracted from Kaggle), and predict the type of crime which occur at particular area. Its main objective is to train model for prediction, to build the model using better algorithms(KNN Algorithm, SVC Algorithm, Decision Tree) depending upon the accuracy. This work helps the law enforcement agencies to predict and reduce the crime rate. WOMEN SAFETY DEVICE The objective of this project is to develop a device like stun gun which, not only produces current but also, sends an alert message and Location to the mobile. Here, To produce current a Voltage generator, battery and switch are used and to send a message and GPS Signal, Arduino mini pro(Micro controller), GPS module and GSM module are used. This project helps to protect a women in a dangerous situation and used as a self-defence object Education 2021 - 2025 B.Tech at SRM University 2020 2019 Class 12th Board of Intermediate Education Class 10th Indian Certificate Of Secondary Education (GPA: 8.46/10) (94/100) (76/100) Skills Skills: PYTHON, C, VHDL Tools: Anaconda, CST, Vivado Last updated: August 10, 2024
