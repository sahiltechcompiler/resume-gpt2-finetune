Rahul Sai Emani  rahulsaiemani | (cid:239) Rahul Sai | # rahulsaiemani@srmap.edu.in | H +91 9704488399 Summary Final year B.Tech Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML). Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in algorithms, data analysis, and Python programming.During my academic journey, I developed a keen interest in applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.Strong problem-solving skills and a commit- ment to staying updated with industry trends.Eager to contribute to innovative AI projects and leverage academic knowledge to drive impactful solutions. Work Experience Artificial Intelligence with python Jul 2022 - Oct 2022 Participated in a work experience project based on AI using python with libraries like pandas and scikit- learn to perform time series forecasting.Build models such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict future trends based on historical data. Projects Air quality index prediction The project addresses the critical public health concern of air pollution, emphasizing the link between exposure to pollutants and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. It highlights the importance of reli- able and real-time monitoring of air quality for health advisories and evidence-based policymaking. The research concludes that advaneed machine learning techniques, especially boosting algorithms, can effec- tively forecast AQI levels. The models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, demonstrated superior performance, explaining over 85 percent of AQI variability in testing data, providing a robust foundation for decision support systems and timely air pollution advisories. Climate Change Monitoring Analysis This project aims to develop a robust software system for monitoring climatic conditions in real-time. The software will collect data from various sensors deployed across geographical locations and provide comprehensive insights into temperature, humidity, air pressure, and other relevant parameters. Users will access the system through a user-friendly interface, enabling them to visualise climatic conditions of the given location. The software will leverage advanced data analytics techniques to predict weather patterns and facilitate informed decision-making for various applications, including agriculture, transportation, and disaster management. By providing accurate and timely information, the Climatic Conditions Monitoring Software contributes to enhancing resilience and adaptability in the face of changing.Implemented using a combination of HTML, CSS for front-end design and interactivity, JavaScript for client-side scripting, and Flask as the back-end framework. Education 2021-Present Bachelors Degree at SRM AP UNIVERSITY Class 12th at Sri Chaitanya College (BIEAP) 2019 - 2021 Class 10th at Nalanda Vidyaniketan (CBSE) 2019 (GPA: 6.92/10) (74) (63.6) Skills Languages: C, C++, Python, Java, MySQL.
