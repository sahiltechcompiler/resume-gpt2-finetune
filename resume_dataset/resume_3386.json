Utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for audio classification. Converted audio waveforms into spectrograms to leverage the power of CNNs for image-like analysis. Trained the CNN model on TensorFlow to differentiate between Capuchin bird calls and other sounds. Implemented a sliding window technique to segment the provided 3-minute audio clip for efficient classification and counting of Capuchin bird calls.",
