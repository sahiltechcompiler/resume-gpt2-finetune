The project starts with collecting and preprocessing relevant datasets, including patient demographics and medical history. EDA is performed to identify patterns and relationships within the data, followed by feature engineering to enhance model performance. The XGBoost model is then trained and optimized, with its performance evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. This predictive model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes by providing a data-driven approach to assessing cervical cancer risk.",
