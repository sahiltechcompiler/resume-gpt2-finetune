Ready to apply knowledge and skills in a real-world setting to contribute to the success of a dynamic organization. Work Experience Data Science Intern May 2024 - present Worked on a Resume Building Website using the AI technology. Key Responsibilities were Data refining and cleaning by annotating the Data. Worked closely with development team to understand the key components and internal working of the LLM built. Data Analyst Jun 2023 - Jul 2023 Gained strong proficiency in Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Developed a project to analyze and visualize student career aspirations using a dataset, focusing on data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and trend identification. Projects E-Commerce WebsiteReactJs,CSS,NodeJs Link to Demo Engineered a responsive UI with React.js and developed a robust backend using Node.js and Express.js. Integrated MongoDB for efficient data management and crafted RESTful APIs to enable seamless com- munication between UI and DB. Implemented secure user authentication for login using JWT. Pothole Detection using Vehicular Networks  OpenCV, Socket Programming Built an Machine Learning model to recognise potholes on roads using the OpenCV object detection. If any Potholes are found, the pothole warning will be sent from the vehicle to the nearest Road Side Unit(RSU) and the warning will be re-transmitted several times to increase the range. For the implementation, used Socket programming from python. Gym Management System  C++ Link to Demo Originally developed in C++, this project leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to improve functionality and maintainability and Security. It uses C++ file systems for secure data storage, acces- sible only by an Admin, demonstrating C++s capability in creating robust, secure, and well-structured applications.
