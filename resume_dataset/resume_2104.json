Data Preprocessing: The source text is tokenized, normalized, and enriched with part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition to ensure the data is clean and structured. Sentence Selection: Identify informative sentences from the text. Question Types: Generate factual, conceptual, and application questions. Distractor Generation: Create plausible incorrect answers. Training the Model: Model Selection: Use a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-4). Fine-Tuning: Train on domain-specific data for improved relevance. Prompt Engineering: Craft prompts to guide question generation. Prediction: The trained model generates MCQs by creating the question stem, options, and identifying the correct answer. Example: From a paragraph about cancer cell characteristics, generate questions about key differences between cancerous and normal cells.",
