        "description": "Objective: Players control a spaceship to shoot down alien invaders before they reach the bottom of the screen. Gameplay: Players can move the spaceship left and right while being able to shoot, and the enemies move left right and down while also shooting projectiles. Features: There are 3 different aliens and a hovering alien that comes and goes for extra points. Graphics and Animation: Scoring System: each alien gives you different points while the hovering alien that comes by giving you the highest score. Challenges and Solutions: Getting all of them to move at the same time using runnable was a challenge but I overcame it by rechecking all the implementations. Code Structure: There is an entity class (Common code for all entities), Alien class (Alien features), Group Alien class (Group them together so they move uniformly), Bullet class (different bullet classes for alien and vessel). Future Improvements: The game can have different levels and the difficulty can be increased as it progresses.",
