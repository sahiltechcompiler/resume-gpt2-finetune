Compared the trade-offs and optimal conditions to guide method selection for specific WSN applications. Key findings: Clustering-Based Approaches:-Conserves energy by reducing communication distance, though cluster heads deplete energy faster; extends network lifetime through periodic re-election; and is highly scalable with easy restructuring. Tree-Based Approaches:-Optimizes multi-hop paths for energy efficiency; network lifetime depends on root and intermediate nodes; moderate scalability; high data accuracy with fewer aggregation points but increased traffic.",
