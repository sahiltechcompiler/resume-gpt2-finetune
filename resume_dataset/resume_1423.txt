This system uses technology for organizing, synchronizing and automating business and sales activities. This is a virtual system and this system does not require any physical offices or environment. So ev- erybody can use this system easily. Administrator can communicate and provide services through this system, and also user can access and check his status and his project opportunity as well as getting more information about the projects and updating systems. 1.2 Identification of the Problem Our current CRM process lacks efficient data integration, resulting in frag- mented customer information and hindering the development of comprehen- sive customer profiles. This fragmentation leads to suboptimal customer experiences and makes it challenging for our sales and marketing teams to personalize interactions effectively. Additionally, the absence of automated data analysis tools limits our ability to derive actionable insights from cus- tomer data, hampering our decision-making processes. Our current CRM systems lack of scalability also restricts its ability to accommodate our 1 growing customer base and evolving business needs. Consequently, these inefficiencies have resulted in missed business opportunities and a decline in overall customer satisfaction. To overcome these challenges, our proposed CRM solution seeks to streamline data integration, enhance data analytics capabilities, and ensure scalability to improve customer engagement and drive business growth. 1.3 Significance of the Problem The Significance of CRM system is to:  Maintain good relationship with customer  Manage business opportunity  Lead Management  Track the business opportunity and develop it  Daily Meeting, Task, Note, Emails with contacts or leads  Alert Notification for meeting or call  Customer Observation The overall purposes are to search, allure and get new clients, nurture and hold those the organization already has. Entice former clients back in to the fold, and decrease marketing and client service cost. 1.4 Research / Project Questions and Objectives In this project, we seek to answer the following key questions: 1. How can we streamline the customer data collection process to en- sure comprehensive and accurate customer profiles? 2. What strategies can be implemented to enhance the efficiency of customer interactions and improve overall customer satisfaction? 2 3. How can we leverage data analytics to gain valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviors, enabling more targeted mar- keting and sales initiatives? To achieve these goals, our primary objectives for the CRM project are as follows: 1. Develop a user-friendly interface for seamless customer data entry and management. 2. Implement automation to expedite routine customer interactions and enhance response times. 3. Integrate advanced analytics tools to derive actionable insights and support informed decision-making for targeted marketing and sales strategies. By addressing these questions and meeting these objectives, we aim to sig- nificantly enhance our CRM capabilities and foster stronger, more profitable customer relationships. 3 Chapter 2 System Overview 2.1 Scope This entire CRM system is web based and creating on open source appli- cations and software. This system is developed in PHP (Laravel Frame- work) with apache web server and database is MySQL. Also included Node JS for User Notification. It is eligible and compatible for every web browser and operating system. 2.2 Key Features In our project we have three types of roles:  Administrator  CRM User  Both (Administrator and CRM) 2.2.1 General  Login: Every user login with their valid username and password. User having only admin access directly goes to admin panel and user having only CRM access goes to CRM panel and user having both accesses goes to app index. 4  App Index App Index contains two parts, Administrator and Cus- tomer Relationship Management(CRM). This part is available only for users having both access (Administrator and CRM). 2.2.2 Administrator  User Management Administrator generates the user and also can edit their details when required. If he wanted, he can add new user and inactive the existing user. Administrator can control user access for both panel (Administrator and CRM)  Set Target Administrator assign sales target for the company and distribute the target between sales persons of the company. 2.2.3 Company Profile Administrator can add or modify company Name, Logo, Address and other information. 2.2.4 CRM User  Dashboard User can observe his contribution and compare with his sales target. He also checks his upcoming task and campaign and views his activities in calendar.  Leads Leads are generated when new client comes and modify by the user. Leads are transforming into the contact when client qualify and assign for new opportunity. If once leads change into contact, then it will end. Leads can be created or imported from CSV file (Maximum 8000 leads at a time). Leads are accessible for only its owner Lead qualifying process consists of 5 steps:  Unqualified  Primary 5  Maturity  Finding  Qualified  Accounts In this system, Accounts represent clients company. Ev- ery Account has multiple clients (Contacts). Accounts are accessible for all users but only owner can modify.  Contacts When lead is qualified, it transforms into contact. Con- It mainly represents clients or tact also can be created directly. customers.  Opportunities When a scope is generated to make business to cus- tomer (Contact/Lead), then we called it opportunity. Opportunity can be won or lost by following 6 steps. Opportunity won means business is succeeded and Opportunity lost means business is failed. Lost reason must be included if it is lost. Opportunity qualifying process consists of 6 steps:  Initial  Analysis  Presentation  Proposal  Negotiate  Closed (Won/Lost) 2.2.5 Activities  Meeting User can call meeting, observe and set the meeting sched- ule. He can also modify the date, time, place of the meeting and inform to the appropriate client. User can set reminder for the meeting. He can also divert the meeting to another user. 6  Task User can create task, observe and set the task schedule. He can also modify the date, priority, status of the task. He can also divert the task to another user.  Note User can create note with details information. It helps user to maintain his work activities.  Call User records call history into system, observe and set the call schedule. He can also modify the date, time, status (Held, Not Held, Planned) of the call. User can set reminder for the call. He can also divert the call to another user.  Email User can send email to leads or contacts. For sending email, User must need to configure the email settings. He can also attach the file.  Calendar User can view his activities (Meetings, Task) in calendar.  Campaign User can create campaign to advertise his business, observe and set the campaign schedule. He can also modify the date, time, budget and actual cost of the campaign. User can also add impressions, expected revenue and actual revenue.  Back Office Setup  Email Configuration Email Configuration is needed for send- ing email.  Products Opportunity consists of different products. Products is created in Back Office.  Product Group It represents product category and needed to create product.  Source It represents Lead Source and needed to create Lead.  Lead Category It is needed to create Lead. 7 Chapter 3 Proposed Model 3.1 Functional Requirements 3.1.1 User Requirements Certainly, user requirements for a CRM system can be summarized as fol- lows: Users expect a user-friendly interface with customizable dashboards for easy navigation and personalized data display. They need efficient data en- try and management, automated task reminders, and comprehensive cus- tomer profiles for effective customer interaction. Access to accessible re- porting and analytics, integration with communication tools, mobile acces- sibility, and collaborative features are also crucial for seamless CRM opera- tions. Meeting these requirements ensures a user-centric CRM system that enhances productivity and customer relationship management. 3.1.2 System Requirements General system requirement deals with both least requirements of hard- ware and software that is required to run the optimal functioning of an application. To run CRM application on a website following things should be re- quired: 8  Operating System  Browser (Firefox, Chrome etc.)  Internet Connection  PC or Mobile devices Using above software and hardware specification one should be able to work with CRM. 3.1.3 Functional Specification Certainly, the functional specifications for a CRM system can be sum- marized as follows:  User authentication and authorization for secure access.  Efficient customer data management including addition, editing, and deletion.  Comprehensive tracking and management of customer interactions and tasks.  Reporting and analytics functionalities for data-driven decision- making.  Integration of marketing automation tools for streamlined cam- paigns.  Effective sales pipeline management for tracking leads and oppor- tunities.  Seamless integration with communication tools for direct customer engagement.  Customizable features to accommodate specific business require- ments. 9 These specifications form the backbone of the CRM system, ensuring efficient and effective customer relationship management and data han- dling. 3.2 Non Functional Requirements 3.2.1 Performance Requirements Performance of CRM deployment is dependent on a number of factors related to the infrastructure and controller services. It is recommended to use high performance Computer or Mobile Device and reliable internet connection 3.2.2 Security Requirements Following steps should take to secure CRM hypervisors: 1. Should must use both firewall and Intrusion Prevention System 2. Strong Password Policy and Password aging policy should enforce mandatorily 3. Implement two steps authentication These security measures are vital to maintaining the integrity and con- fidentiality of customer data and protecting the CRM system from po- tential security breaches and vulnerabilities. 3.2.3 Usability Requirements Certainly, the usability requirements for a CRM system can be summa- rized as follows:  Intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and task execution.  Consistent design and layout across all modules to ensure a seamless user experience. 10  Customizable dashboards to display relevant information based on specific user roles.  Clear and organized information hierarchy for efficient data access and retrieval.  Responsive design adaptable to various screen sizes and devices.  Accessible help resources and documentation for user support and guidance.  Comprehensive training and ongoing technical support to facilitate effective system utilization. By meeting these usability requirements, the CRM system can provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing customer relation- ships and enhancing overall business operations. 11 Chapter 4 Designing Of Project 4.1 Data Flow Diagrams A data flow diagram (DFD) maps out the flow of information for any pro- cess or system. It uses defined symbols like rectangles, circles and arrows, plus short text labels, to show data inputs, outputs, storage points and the routes between each destination.A DFD describes what data flow (logical) rather than how they are processed, so it does not depend on hardware, software, data structure or file organization. Data flowcharts can range from simple, even hand-drawn process overviews, to indepth, multi-level DFDs that dig progressively deeper into how the data is handled. They can be used to analyze an existing system or model a new one. Like all the best diagrams and charts, a DFD can often visually say things that would be hard to explain in words, and they work for both technical and nontechnical audiences, from developer to CEO. Thats why DFDs remain so popular after all these years. While they work well for data flow software and systems, they are less applicable nowadays to visualizing interactive, real-time or database-oriented software or systems. DFDs are one of three essential perspectives of the structured systems analysis and design method. Sponsors of a project and end users will need to be briefed and consulted throughout all stages of a systems evolution. 12 Figure 4.1: Data Flow Diagram of online CRM 13 4.2 Use Cases It has all the information of the Use case Model display in the previous picture. We have narrated use case with a table in the following section. Each table shows five types of detail information about a use case. They are Use case name, Actor, PreCondition, Primary Path, and Exceptional Path. Use case name refers to the name of the process. Actor identi- fies who will be the user. Pre-condition means whether or not another process is required to enter or use this process. Primary Path indicates step by step works of the process. Exceptional Path shows us what the process will do if any exception occurs in a primary path. We provide fourteen tables with detailed information on the processes of the CRM project. 14 Figure 4.2: Use Case Diagram for CRM 4.2.1 Use Case Model The following diagram indicates the use case model for CRM. Here three kinds of user are present. A Supervisor (Admin) user can perform all the processes after login into the system. On the other hand, a normal user can handle note, client, actual sale, reminders, change password, etc. He also needs to be logged in the system. Another CRM System user can also handle reminders. 4.2.2 Use Case Description It has all the information of the Use case Model display in the previous picture. We have narrated use case with a table in the following section. Each table shows five types of detail information about a use case. They are Use case name, Actor, PreCondition, Primary Path, and Exceptional 15 Path. Use case name refers to the name of the process. Actor identifies who will be the user. Pre-condition means whether or not another process is required to enter or use this process. Primary Path indicates step by step works of the process. Exceptional Path shows us what the process will do if any exception occurs in a primary path. We provide fourteen tables with detailed information on the processes of the CRM project. Table 5.1 Describes the login process of our project and it gives us an understanding of how the process works in the project. The login pro- cess has three primary paths. In these three primary paths, there are two exceptional paths. Table 5.2 Describes the Change Password process of our project. The Change Password process has four primary paths. In these four primary paths, there are two exceptional paths. Table 5.3 Describes the User Manage process of our project and it gives us an understanding of how this process works in the project. The User Manage process has eight primary paths. In these eight primary paths, there are two exceptional paths. Table 5.4 Describes the User Access process of our project and it gives us an understanding of how this process works in the project. The User Access process has three primary paths. In these three primary paths, there are two exceptional paths. Table 5.5 Describes about Set Target process of our project and it gives us an understanding how this process works in project. Set Target process has five primary paths. In this five primary paths have two exceptional paths. 16 Use case name Actor Pre-condition Primary Path Exceptional Path Login Admin, CRM User None 1.

Each of them has an important role in CRM strategy, and an organization that wants to success must understand the value of using these three categories effectively: Operational CRM deals with the automation of certain processes in the organization. When a contact is made with a customer, the information of this interaction will be automatically inscribed in a database, and the orga- nization will be able to have all the considered necessary information of that customer when it is needed. The next essential element of CRM architecture is analytical CRM. Analytical CRM deals with analyzing data that is collected by the or- ganization. This information will be analyzed so that the organization can improve its customer service facilities. By improving its customer service facility, the organization will be able to build stronger relationships with its customers and gain their loyalty, which can be translated as more profits. 19 There are many ways that analytical CRM can be used in order to achieve this. It can be used to make available essential information to customers in a short period of time. Moreover, analytical CRM can evaluate the methods of sales, inven- tory, and profits in order to find new methods that are not consistent. Analytical CRM is also important when it is part of product develop- ment and risk management processes. It is important for the organization to understand that analytical CRM is a continuing procedure and may there is the need to adjust its methods to this information that is examined through analytical CRM process. The third important component of CRM architecture is collaborative CRM. This aspect is important because it gives emphasis on the contacts that the organization will make with its customers. These contacts could be personal, or they could come through medi- ums such as telephone or mails. When contacts are made with customers, collaborative CRM allows the organization to present them helpful in- formation, through a powerful form of communication that will use nu- merous methods and technologies. Since the aim of CRM is to discover customers needs, wants and expectations and try to filled them, collecting and analyzing the infor- mation from the contacts with the customers will help to strengthen the relationships with the customers. Customer relationship management may be the most dynamic solu- tion in order to stop problems before they arise. Preventing problems is much easier and costs less than trying to solve them when they occur. 20 Figure 5.1: system architecure 21 Chapter 6 Methodology Used 6.1 Database Design A database design is a collection of stored data organized in such a way that the data requirements are satisfied by the database. The general objective is to make information access easy, quick, inexpensive, and flex- ible for the user. There are also some specific objectives like controlled redundancy, privacy, security, and performance. A collection of related records makes up a table. To design and store data in the needed forms, database tables are prepared. Two essential settings for a database are:  Primary key: A primary key is a special relational database table column (or combination of columns) designated to uniquely identify all table records.  Foreign key: A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. 6.1.1 Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Entity Relationship Diagram, also known as ERD, ER Diagram, or ER model, is a type of structural diagram used in database design. An ERD contains different symbols and connectors that visualize two important 22 pieces of information: the major entities within the system scope, and the inter-relationships among these entities. It is most often used to design or debug relational databases in the fields of software engineering, business information systems, education, and research. They use a defined set of symbols such as rectangles, diamonds, ovals, and connecting lines to depict the interconnectedness of entities, relationships, and their attributes.
