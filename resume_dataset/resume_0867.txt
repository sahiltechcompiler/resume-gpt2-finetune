The first is individual consumers who utilize fintech apps for tasks like mobile banking, payments, and budgeting. These services offer convenience, accessibility, and potentially lower fees than traditional options. The second group encompasses established financial institutions like banks and insurers. Fintech provides them with tools for data analysis, fraud prevention, and even creating new financial products. This allows traditional institutions to stay competitive and improve their services for their own customer base. Fintech companies cast a wide net, serving two distinct customer groups.

A) Online short-term loan providers act like your direct lender, offering fast approvals and clear terms, but with potentially stricter regulations and higher interest rates. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms connect you with individual investors for your loan, allowing for potentially lower interest rates but with less transparency and a longer wait time as you need to attract lenders on the platform. Deciding between online short-term loans and P2P lending for quick cash depends on your priorities. Short-term lenders offer speed and transparency with upfront terms, but potentially higher interest due to regulations. P2P lending might have lower rates but comes with less transparency, a range of potential interest based on your credit, and a wait for lenders to be attracted to your loan offer. 5) Give an example of a cryptocurrency that can be used for payments through fintech services.

A) Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms challenge traditional investment methods by offering a more direct approach.
