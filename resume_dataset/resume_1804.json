After performing feature extraction, I employed classification algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, and also used ensemble methods. By using ensemble methods, model accuracy increases from 78% to 90%. Furthermore, we utilized MATLAB to implement five deep learning models and achieved a highest accuracy of 97%.",
