Carried out data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency, using feature engineering to highlight key song attributes such as tempo, energy, and danceability.  Collaborated with team members to plan and execute the project, documenting findings and presenting results to supervisors, ensuring timely completion and achieving project objectives. Projects DiabetesCompass - Navigating Health with AI Project Link  Implemented predictive models for diabetes risk using both Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, enhancing the ability to identify individuals at high risk of diabetes.  Performed comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values and applying QuantileTransformer for data normalization, ensuring high-quality input data for the models.  Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify and analyze key features correlated with diabetes outcome, providing deeper insights and improving the models effectiveness. Online Fraud Detection System Project Link  Engineered an online fraud detection system employing multiple algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, k-NN, and a Voting Ensemble Classifier, significantly enhancing fraud detection accuracy.  Executed extensive data preprocessing, incorporating standard scaling and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to improve model performance and reduce dimensionality, ensuring high-quality input data.  Implemented thorough evaluation and validation techniques, including cross-validation and performance metrics analysis, to ensure the robustness and reliability of the fraud detection system. Project Link CineMind-Predictive-Movie-Matchmaking  Developed a content-based movie recommendation system using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, enhancing user experience through personalized movie suggestions.  Applied vectorization methods like TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words, and algorithms such as Cosine Similarity using Python, NLTK, and Scikit-Learn to convert movie titles and metadata into vectors for precise recommendations.  Coordinated thorough data extraction, preprocessing, and feature engineering to optimize the recommendation systems performance, ensuring high accuracy and relevance of movie suggestions.
