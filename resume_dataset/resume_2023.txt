Integrated YOLOv5 for real-time vehicle detection and classification with 95% accuracy, enhancing traffic light dynamics by categorizing vehicles into light, medium, and heavy classes.  This innovative approach contributes to efficient traffic flow management, crucial for smart traffic systems in major cities. Testing Autonomous Vehicle Models in Rural Conditions Apr 2023  Oct 2023  Conducted simulations in CARLA to replicate rural and dynamic weather scenarios.  Evaluated the performance of pre-existing autonomous vehicle models under these conditions.  Achieved 85-92% accuracy by training a custom object detection and path optimization model using VirConv-L on a custom dataset. Projects DermaAI | Dermatological Diagnostic Aid Mar 2024  Apr 2024  A portable solution using a Dermatoscope and machine learning to detect skin diseases in underserved regions. Captures high-res images (up to 200x zoom) and provides preliminary analysis, recommending further medical help when needed.  Implemented the ResNet50v2 model trained on a diverse dataset of skin diseases. Incorporated disease-free skin data and layer-freezing techniques, achieving 92.36% accuracy in disease classification and enhancing model robustness. LocalDoc | Personal - Private LLM Nov 2023  Jan 2024  Utilizing Mistral 7B instruct as an LLM, I developed a personalized, secure, and offline RAG model. This model enables users to upload personal documents and pose questions while ensuring privacy by operating locally.  The LangChain framework was used alongside the Sentence Transformers embedding model and ChromaDB for vector storage. Hosted the project using Streamlit for seamless interaction and accessibility. Hospital Management System | Admin Portal Mar 2023  Apr 2023  Developed a user-friendly website for efficient management and storage of essential information regarding doctors, patients, nurses, workers, rooms, and other vital aspects.  Employed HTML, CSS, and JS for the front-end design and functionality, SQL for data storage and retrieval and PHP to enable dynamic request and responses.
