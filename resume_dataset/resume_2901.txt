Employed DFS-based recursive similarity score calculation and branch pruning to minimize the context returned to the LLM without informational loss. Outperformed existing querying mechanisms on the NarrativeQA dataset by an absolute performance gain of 10.85%. Doomscroll October 2023 Leveraging AI and Short-Form Content for Enhanced Educational Engagement among Gen-Z October 2023 Hackathon Project Built an LLM-based short-video generation engine for creating highly-engaging educational content. This project targets the Goldfish Attention Span Crisis in Gen-Z, caused by short-form video content. Advancing Churn Prediction through Explainable AI April 2024 Currently engaged in cutting-edge research on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for churn prediction, employing techniques like SHAP and LIME to decipher influential factors in customer churn and interpret complex machine learning models. Leading investigations into customer segmentation, temporal churn dynamics, and ensuring model fairness and regulatory compliance. . Comic Book Generator: Leveraging GANs February 2024 Currently developing a GAN-based comic book generator using the Manga109 dataset and Python libraries such as Ten- sorFlow and OpenCV. Combining deep learning techniques with computer vision, the project aims to generate captivating comics from textual story inputs.
