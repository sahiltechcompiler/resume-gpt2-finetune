        "description": "Developed a dynamic e-commerce site with a React frontend, leveraging React Router DOM for seamless navigation, Axios for API requests, and Tailwind for modern, responsive styling. Built a robust backend using Express, with middleware integration including body-parser for JSON handling, CORS for cross-origin requests, and Mongoose for MongoDB cloud connection, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval. Implemented JWT for secure token-based authentication. This project deepened my understanding of full-stack development, particularly in integrating frontend and backend technologies, handling user authentication, and ensuring data persistence and security in an e-commerce application.",

        "description": "Throughout my three-month internship at AWS Cloud facilitated by APSSDC, I gained foundational and practical familiarity with a range of Amazon Web Services (AWS) functionalities. As the culmination of the internship approached, we were assigned the development of a project leveraging these services. I developed online contact manager using React, Material-UI, Tailwind CSS, and integrated with various AWS services including AWS SDK, AWS DynamoDB, and AWS EC2. The site allows users to securely log in, save, and access their contacts, ensuring convenience and accessibility across devices with an internet connection. The user interface is intuitively designed to provide a seamless user experience. Time constraints limited our ability to encompass every AWS feature. Nonetheless, the experience proved immensely enriching, offering significant insights into cloud computing technologies.",
