Evaluated and refined critical parameters such as ship-date, ship-mode, product-name, sales, quantity, discount, shipping-cost, and order-priority; achieved a 15% increase in customer retention and reduced shipping errors by 25% till 2021.  Conducted comprehensive data analysis to identify trends and correlations among KPIs; Improved customer satisfaction by 20% and boosted service efficiency by 30% through targeted improvements Projects Predictive Loan Approval Modeling with Machine Learning Mar 2019 - Jan 2021  Led a machine learning project to predict loan approvals, utilizing datasets from Kaggle. This involved spearheading the end-to-end development and implementation of predictive models.  Enhanced model accuracy by applying data preprocessing and various algorithmic approaches, coupled with rigorous evaluation using train-test splits to refine data mining and machine learning methodolo- gies. Advanced Plant Disease Detection with ML Ensemble Aug 2023 - Dec 2023  Directed a research initiative on plant leaf classification, enhancing predictive precision by employing an ensemble of machine learning models for distinguishing between healthy and diseased specimens.  Pioneered a unique method by incorporating the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to boost decision-level accuracy, achieving results on par with established models through a blend of referenced techniques and recent innovations. Emergency Patient Routing Dec 2023 - Jan 2024  Developed and implemented a Patient Routing Application that optimizes emergency medical assistance using fuzzy logic, geospatial data, and real-time mapping. The system evaluates patient vital signs and directs them to the nearest, most suitable healthcare facilities, effectively reducing response times.  Designed to handle imprecise inputs, the application improves decision-making in emergency scenarios by assessing factors like heart rate, blood pressure, and traffic conditions. Demonstrated the systems efficacy through simulations and real-world testing, showcasing significant improvements in emergency patient transportation and care delivery.
