The project aimed to assist consumers in making informed purchasing decisions and select the best laptop in their price range and with all the matching configurations. Gathered and cleaned a data set of laptop specifications including brand, processor, memory, storage, screen size, and other relevant features. Implemented various machine learning algorithms including linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, selecting the model with the highest predictive accuracy using confusion matrix.",
