TECH (Information Technology) at Manipal University Jaipur 2021 2019 Higher Secondary Education, SLS DAV Public School, Delhi Secondary Education, SLS DAV Public School, Delhi (7.72/10) (81.6) (82.6) SKILLS Languages: Data Visualization: Power Bi Frameworks: Core Subjects: Java, Python, MySQL NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Angular Js Object Oriented Programming (OOPs), RDBMS, Computer Networks, Computer Vision and Image Processing PROJECTS Predicting Next Events and Timestamps in Process Monitoring: A Deep Fusion Approach  Implemented a Fusion Model Architecture (FMA) to predict next events and timestamps of event logs (Help Desk and BPI12) in business organizations.  Furthermore, enhanced accuracy and efficiency by incorporating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms, reducing training time by 55 percent. SONAR Rock Vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning  Worked on this SONAR dataset i picked up from Kaggle, and applied a Logistic Regression model and it gave me an accuracy score of 83.4 percent.  Divided the SONAR dataset into train and test datasets and then pre-processed it before fitting logistic regression to the training set.  In this model, mines were predicted as mines 30 times, 5 times mines were predicted as rocks, rocks were predicted as mines 7 times, and 21 times rocks were predicted as rocks. COURSES AND CERTIFICATIONS Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp, Udemy Jan 2022 - Present AWS Cloud with Artificial Intelligence Workshop, LinuxWorld March 2024 Programming Essentials in Python, Cisco Networking Academy Jan 2024 - May 2024 Introduction to Networks, Cisco Networking Academy Jan 2024 - May 2024 Swayam NPTEL - Design and Analysis of Algorithms, IIT Madras July 2023- Sept 2023 Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp - Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, October 2022
