        "description": "Developed RESTful APIs for authentication, video uploads, comments, likes, and subscriptions, improving response time by approximately 20%. Integrated Multer for file uploads and Mongoose for database management, reducing error rates during data handling by 30%. Utilized Cloudinary for media storage, which decreased media delivery latency by about 15% and reduced server-side storage costs. Secured APIs with JWT and implemented Bcrypt for password hashing, resulting in a noticeable reduction in unauthorized access attempts. Designed a flexible data schema to manage users, videos, playlists, comments, and subscriptions, supporting a growing user base.",
