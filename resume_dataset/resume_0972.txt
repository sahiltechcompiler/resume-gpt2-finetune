The blind user can authenticate with fingerprint, issue voice commands to perform face recognition, object detection  The blind user can use this app to detect and save human faces, detect objects in front of him/her, get voice output of text within objects also send his/her GPS location for tracing purposes Waste identification and segregation  we have prepared a substantial collection of waste images and trained a machine learning model.  By simply capturing an image of the waste with their mobile device, users can receive an instant classification of the waste into categories such as paper, plastic, glass, metal, and more, via the machine learning model House price prediction  This site gives the best price of the house according to the user requirement by reading the dataset Osteoarthritis Detection  Arthritis is a disorder that causes swelling, tenderness, inflammation, stiffness etc. in one or more joints.  In This We use Xray image for detection of Osteoarthritis CERTIFICATIONS  Aws certified cloud practitioner: Amazon  Cisco Packet Trace  Python Programming Basis: Huwae  Basics of python: Infosys springboard  Introduction to cyber security: skill up SKILLS  Python  C  C++ INTERESTS Music, Travelling, Reading, Motorcycling
