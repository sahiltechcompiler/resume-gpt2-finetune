My analytical mindset, attention to detail, and collaborative skills enable me to thrive in dynamic environments. I am eager to contribute and drive positive change through innovative solutions. Projects 1) Invoice Entity Extraction Tool using NER Model | Python, CRF, Label Studio  Developed a natural language processing solution to extract details from invoices using advanced technologies like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python.  Built the CRF model with default hyperparameters: - LBFGS optimization algorithm - L1 and L2 regularization parameters set to 0.1 - 100 epochs giving an F1, precision, and recall scores were 94%, 94%, and 95% respectively. 2) HAND GESTURE BASED VOLUME CONTROL | OpenCV, Python  Authored a sophisticated volume control system using computer vision techniques and various python libraries such as Scikit- Learn.  Enabled users to adjust audio levels through natural hand gestures, enhancing user experience. 3) MUSIC RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM | Kaggle, Python, NumPy  Content-Based Recommender is used which analyzes user's past song history and the properties of the music, the system will  generate a list of recommended tracks. The model uses the Spotify dataset which contains a variety of features such as acousticness, liveness, loudness, tempo, and others.
