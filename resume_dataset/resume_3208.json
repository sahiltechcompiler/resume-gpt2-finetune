Done advanced image processing techniques, including RGB to grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and (CNN) model adopts the LeNet architecture. normalization, Read multiple research papers, focusing on sign detection, sign relevance, and text recognition. On research I found large dataset and fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN model can significantly improve traffic sign classification performance. A traffic sign classification system using the GTSRB dataset achieved a 99.77% accuracy rate. The system was able to classify various traffic signs in real-world scenarios.",
