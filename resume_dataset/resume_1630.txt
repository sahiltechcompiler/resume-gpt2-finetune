TECH (Computer Science Engineering) Polytechnic (CSE) CBSE (Class X) PROJECTS 2021-2025 NIET Greater Noida 2018-21 Jayoti Vidyapeeth Womens University Jaipur 2018 D.A.V Public School 73.33% 74% 72% Driver Drowsiness Detection System: Developed a driver drowsiness detection system using Java, leveraging machine learning algorithms and real- time image processing to analyze driver behavior and detect signs of fatigue. Implemented features such as facial recognition and eye-tracking to monitor and assess drowsiness levels, providing timely alerts to prevent accidents. Integrated the system with a user-friendly interface for easy deployment and real-time feedback, enhancing road safety and driver awareness. Two House Prediction Price Using Machine Learning: Developed and implemented a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. Utilized Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, model building, and visualization. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, employing algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting. Conducted model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE and R, achieving high accuracy and performance. The model was deployed on AWS, making it accessible for real-time predictions.
