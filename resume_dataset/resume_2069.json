Engineered and implemented 40% of the project using Web3.js and React.js for the user interface, and integrated MetaMask for user authentication. Developed 60% of the project by implementing Ethereum smart contracts for token generation and handled blockchain interactions. Provided a well-written, safe DApp for creating and controlling ERC20 tokens. Created 20 unique tokens during local testing.",

Trained the model with an Uber dataset containing 30,000 records and saved in a .pkl file for predictions. Focused and created 20% of the project with a user interface form using HTML, CSS, and JS. Involved 80% of the project by training the model with Python, saving it in a .pkl file, and creating a Flask API for predictions. Executed a system that provides accurate fare estimates by taking multiple factors. Achieved an accuracy rate of 93.64% in local testing scenarios.",
