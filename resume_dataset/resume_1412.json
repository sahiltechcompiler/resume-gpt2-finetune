It includes labeling an image with English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training. The image net dataset trains the CNN model called Xception. Managed data integrity by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, enhancing quality by 33%. Xception is responsible for image feature extraction. These extracted features will be fed to the LSTM model, which generates the image caption. Identified and comprehended key factors influencing academic performance through thorough analysis.",
