Implemented machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest), optimizing them for high accuracy. Visualized sentiment trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Leveraged Python libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK) to enhance computational efficiency. DATA SCIENCE 6-week online training completed on 16th October 2022 Internshala During the training, I developed a Driver drowsiness detection system With a load model function from Keras Driver drowsiness detection systems is designed to help drivers stay awake while driving, in order to reduce the risk of accidents caused by drowsinestest . Key Features:  CNN: extract relevant features from images  OpenCV: Testing code  NumPy, and Matplotlib: display the test image, and to make predictions using the pre- trained CNN model.  Support Vector Machine (SVM)  Hidden Markov Model (HMM  ROI: identification of subtle changes in the eyes
