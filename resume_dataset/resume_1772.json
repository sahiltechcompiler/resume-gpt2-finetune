The tool allows users to visualize the process of finding the shortest path between two points on a grid using algorithms such as A* (A-star), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS). Integrated interactive features to allow users to draw obstacles, specify start and end points, and initiate pathfinding simulations. Leveraged event-driven programming in JavaScript to update the grid dynamically during pathfinding simulations and provide real-time visualization feedback.",
