Projects Single Image Dehazing Click here This project introduces a unique approach to satellite image dehazing by utilizing fusion-based techniques. The method involves blending two adjusted variants of the original hazy image using specific weight maps and inputs derived from the original image. The per-pixel blending strategy minimizes the loss of image structure and preserves important details. The technique demonstrates enhanced efficiency, produces precise and haze-free images, and shows potential for real-time applications. File Compressor Click here This project focuses on data compression using the Huffman coding algorithm. The purpose is to compress a text file without losing any data. Huffman coding assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequency, with more common characters having shorter codes. The implementation involves probability calculation, binary tree transformation, and assigning codes to symbols. The result is an encoded output in 0s and 1s, with a compression ratio close to 2:1. Future work includes implementing the LZW algorithm and adding a graphical interface to the project..
