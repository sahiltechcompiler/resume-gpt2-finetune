Working on prediction model using regression process through studying different model such as ARIMA, SARIMAX, LSTM and other concepts. (ongoing) It is a implementation of 14 parameters with a wide data variation to predict output.  Projects Autonomous Vehicle Using Road Sign Recognition Jan 2024 - May 2024  Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model using Preprocessing Pipeline for image classification.   Done advanced image processing techniques, including RGB to grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and (CNN) model adopts the LeNet architecture. normalization,  Read multiple research papers, focusing on sign detection, sign relevance, and text recognition.  On research I found large dataset and fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN model can significantly improve traffic sign classification performance.  A traffic sign classification system using the GTSRB dataset achieved a 99.77% accuracy rate. The system was able to classify various traffic signs in real-world scenarios Full Stack Developer, E-Commerce Website Aug 2023  Dec 2023  Developed a website with a back end for the E-Commerce as a college project.  Developed a front-end where there are 3 types of users such as Buyer, seller, server. With different functionality such as buying, selling, adding or removal of product from database. Backend was managed using flask and MySQL. Technologies: HTML,CSS, JavaScript, Flask, MySQL   IRIS Flower Classification  Performed EDA and used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as classification model for 150 sample datasets.
