Common people lack legal knowledge so they will be benefited from it. c) The project gives an abstractive summary which is more accurate than an extractive summary.  Fake News Chrome Extension Tech used - Python 3.10, Javascript, FastAPI, Jupyter Notebook, Machine Learning, Transformers etc. a) The user can select the news headline and the extension will tell them if the news is fake or legit. b) The model used in my project is the RobertaForSequenceClassification model. It is a variant of the BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. c) This model is trained on the LIAR dataset. My model gives 50.6% accuracy which is quite average for these types of projects.
