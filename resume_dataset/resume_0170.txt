Projects Image Generation using DCGAN Link to Demo - Implemented Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for image recognition, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as the machine learning algorithm. Achieved robust image generation and recognition capabilities, showcasing proficiency in advanced machine learning techniques. This project was done as a part Undergraduate Research Opportunity program. House Price Prediction Link to Demo - I developed a machine learning project focused on house price prediction in Bangalore. The project involved several data preprocessing steps, including handling null values, dimensionality reduction, feature I utilized three prediction algorithms, engineering, feature scaling, and outlier detection and removal. achieving an impressive 99 percent accuracy in the output ConnectZ Link to Demo - I worked on the development of ConnectZ, a full-stack project aimed at creating a platform similar to LinkedIn. We leveraged React for the frontend to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface, while Firebase served as our backend to manage data storage and authentication. Our focus was on generating dynamic pages to display user profiles, posts, etc., and we also enabled one-to-one chat. Our goal was to deliver a high-quality, scalable solution that met the demands of professional networking and communication.
