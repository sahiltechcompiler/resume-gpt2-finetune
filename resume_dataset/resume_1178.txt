PROJECTS MUSIC GENRE CLASSIFICATION Apr24  Domain: Deep Learning  Developed and optimized a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras for audio classification tasks. Applied MFCCs for feature extraction and statistical analysis to enhance model accuracy.  Implemented a feedforward neural network architecture with multiple hidden layers and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. Contributed to the advancement of deep learning applications in audio processing and automated music genre classification. DIABETES PREDICTION Nov22  Domain: Machine Learning  This project centers on predicting diabetes using supervised machine learning methods: SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN. Evaluated model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare the effectiveness of different algorithms.  The main objective is to develop a system for early diabetes prediction with higher accuracy by combining results from diverse learning techniques. FINDING GIFT May22  Domain: HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT  Users are tasked with identifying gifts within a puzzle.
