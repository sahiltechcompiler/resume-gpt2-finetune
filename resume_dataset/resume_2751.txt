Accurate prediction of a satellite's remaining useful life is crucial for mission planning, timely maintenance, and ensuring the longevity of satellite operations Chest X Ray detection using Transfer Learning The goal is to create a system that uses transfer learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Pneumonia, a severe lung infection, requires early detection for effective treatment. However, manual analysis of X-ray images is time-consuming and prone to errors. Transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained models, can efficiently solve this task Portfolio Developed many different clone sites using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap INTERNSHIPS Celebal Technologies (Data Science) May24-July24 Assisted in data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing to ensure high-quality datasets for analysis Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data Developed and implemented machine learning models to solve business problems, such as predictive analytics and classification tasks ACHIEVEMENTS APERTRE24 (Open-Source Event)- Top 10 Finalist AIML Co-Lead in GDSC NIET(2023-2024) Won SIH internal hackathon Participated in NIET IDEA -2023 Participated in Project Exhibition-2022 (Face Recognition Project) - 1st Prize Campus Ambassador - IIT Delhi (2022) AWS -AIML Scholar24 POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY AI-CoLead GDSC NIET Led and coordinated AI-related projects and initiatives within the GDSC community Conducted workshops and training sessions on AI concepts, machine learning algorithms, and tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch Organized and participated in hackathons, coding competitions, and other events to promote AI learning and innovation Campus Ambassador - IIT Delhi (2022) Promoted IIT Delhi events, programs, and initiatives on campus and through social media channels Organized and coordinated campus events, workshops, and seminars to increase student engagement and participation
