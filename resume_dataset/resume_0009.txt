The plan involves developing a Java-based blockchain framework, integrating it with existing systems, and evaluating its performance, security, and scalability. Case studies and comparisons with conventional methods will be conducted to confirm the solution's efficacy. The healthcare supply chain, with its complex network of entities, faces challenges such as a lack of information and centralized control, leading to inefficiencies and the entry of counterfeit drugs. The proposed blockchain solution aims to address these issues and enhance the overall effectiveness of the supply chain.
