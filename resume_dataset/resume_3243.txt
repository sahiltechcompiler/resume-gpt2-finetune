Utilized the Google Gemini API to fetch tailored diet plans, ensuring accurate and goal-specific nutritional recommendations.  Implemented a robust backend using Node.js to handle API calls and manage communication between the frontend and external services. HAR  Created a model that accurately predicts human activities using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.  Attained an accuracy of up to 88% in predicting human activities, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model. Chatbot  Implemented an interactive chatbot capable of answering user queries using both predefined question-answer pairs and information extracted from PDF documents.  Employed natural language processing tools (NLTK, scikit-learn) for tokenizing, vectorizing, and measuring text similarity to accurately match user queries with relevant information.  Used Chainlit for building the chatbot interface, handling user interactions, and managing the conversation flow.  Leveraged PyMuPDF (fitz) for efficient text extraction from PDF files, ensuring accurate information retrieval and improving overall response relevance. Letterboxer  Developed a program that scrapes movie streaming availability information from individual watchlists using BeautifulSoup and requests html.  Extracted movie titles and their respective streaming services from the HTML content of Letterboxd watchlist links, ensuring accurate data retrieval.  Implemented the program to compile streaming availability into a dictionary and export the data into a JSON file for easy access and further analysis.  Incorporated randomized sleep intervals between requests to avoid rate limiting. SMS Classifier  Created an interactive web application using Streamlit to classify text data efficiently.  Employed TFIDFVectorizer to convert text data into numerical vectors before feeding it to the classification model, ensuring effective feature extraction.  Integrated the trained model into the Streamlit app, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time text classification and analysis.
