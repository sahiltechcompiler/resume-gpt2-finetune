Divided the SONAR dataset into train and test datasets and then pre-processed it before fitting logistic regression to the training set. In this model, mines were predicted as mines 30 times, 5 times mines were predicted as rocks, rocks were predicted as mines 7 times, and 21 times rocks were predicted as rocks.",
