        "description": "Trained and evaluated sign language recognition models using MediaPipe: The preprocessed image was passed to the MediaPipe Holistic model for detection. The model processes the image and outputs a results object containing information about detected landmarks on the face, pose, left hand, and right hand. Performed Real-time Visualization and Inference that displays the captured video feed with overlaid hand landmarks. It performs inference using a trained model to predict the most likely action (sign language gesture) for each frame. Aims at providing enhanced accessibility for people with hearing impairments.",

Conducted thorough EDA and visualization, including word cloud generation and frequency distribution. Implemented various neural network architectures like Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Bidirectional models with embedding layers. Experimented with encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding, count vectorization, TF-IDF, and custom Word2Vec embeddings. Achieved the highest validation accuracy of 0.75389 with the Embedding + Bidirectional + GRU model.",
