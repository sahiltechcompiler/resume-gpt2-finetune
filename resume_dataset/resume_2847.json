The attendance model analyzed faces using webcam input and stored the attendance. The performance detection model contained an eye detection model and an emotion detection model. The eye-detection model analyzed whether the eyes of a student were open or closed while the emotion-detection model analyzed the emotions of a student during a particular class. The entire project was made using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras Library.",
