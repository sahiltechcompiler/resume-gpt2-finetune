PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE Research- An Empirical study of Precision Agriculture  In this research, I developed and implemented statistical models for plant leaf disease detection using a leaf dataset.  After performing feature extraction, I employed classification algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, and also used ensemble methods. By using ensemble methods, model accuracy increases from 78% to 90%.  Furthermore, we utilized MATLAB to implement five deep learning models and achieved a highest accuracy of 97%. June 2023  Feb 2024 PROJECTS Credit Card Recommendation  Employed demographic classification, Used spending behavior analysis, Segmented customers efficiently.  Identified key target groups for personalized credit card recommendations, Designed a Power BI dashboard featuring Jan 2024 key performance indicators KPIs and utilized DAX formulas to create dynamic calculations and enhance data analysis. Insights to Identify the Best Amazon Merchants Aug 2024  Cleaned and extracted key seller data using SQL and Power BI. Analyzed and segmented sellers based on interactions, product counts, and rating metrics.  I analyzed and segmented sellers to identify the top 200 best-performing sellers from the dataset using Power BI.  By developing actionable insights, I was able to pinpoint high-performing merchants and support decision-making through interactive visualizations.  Tools/Technologies: SQL, Power BI, DAX, Data Visualization Job portal  Developed a fully dynamic system with real-time updates for job listings, user profiles, and application statuses  Implemented three distinct user roles: job seekers, job providers (employers), and admin.
