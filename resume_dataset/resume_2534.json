Designed a machine learning model by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on 200 CT scan images, with 160 images in the training set and 40 images in the test set depicting brain hemorrhages. Achieved an accuracy rate of 87% in order to function a robust diagnostic tool for identifying and classifying brain hemorrhages, showcasing the models potential in the field of Radiology and healthcare.",
