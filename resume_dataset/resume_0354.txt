Engineered a process to convert audio .wav files into grayscale satellite images, integrating graphical user interface (GUI) capabilities.  Designed and implemented artificial colorization techniques to transform grayscale satellite images into RGB format, enhancing visual representation. Generating Poem Texts using RNN 2024  Designed and implemented a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate original poem texts.  Trained the model on a large dataset of poems to capture stylistic and thematic elements.  Fine-tuned hyperparameters and utilized techniques like dropout to improve model performance and creativity. Movie Success Rate Prediction 2023  Developed a predictive model to estimate movie success based on factors like genre, budget, cast, director, release date, and marketing efforts.  Analysed historical movie data using machine learning techniques, including regression, classification, and ensemble methods.
