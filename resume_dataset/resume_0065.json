By leveraging machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and random forest, we aim to create robust and accurate tools for assessing credit risk. Our approach includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The logistic regression model provides interpretability by highlighting key factors influencing default probability, while the random forest model enhances predictive accuracy through ensemble learning. This project aims to provide financial institutions with reliable models to improve decision-making and reduce financial risk.",
