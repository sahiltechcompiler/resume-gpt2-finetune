Its main objective is to train model for prediction, to build the model using better algorithms(KNN Algorithm, SVC Algorithm, Decision Tree) depending upon the accuracy. This work helps the law enforcement agencies to predict and reduce the crime rate.",

The company had two sessions, Solder session and Leaded assembling session, I have worked in leaded assembling session where all components like resistors, capacitors, transistor.. allSMD devices are mounted on PCB with solder paste manually. After, assembling they are sent to (QC) Quality Checker, where in this session all PCB Boards are tested and checked and, if any PCB is damaged or misplaced any component, it will replaced with new one.",
