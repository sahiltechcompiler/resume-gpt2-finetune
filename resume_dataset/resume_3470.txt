Mar 2019  Mar 2019 10th, DLF Public School Ghaziabad Ghaziabad I completed my 10th grade education at DLF Public School in Ghaziabad, following the CBSE curriculum, where I achieved an impressive score of 87%. C# Python Java Proficient Highly Proficient Proficient MySQL JavaScript Highly Proficient Proficient Languages Air Canvas I developed a Python program that utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize hand gestures through a user's camera. The program was designed to capture video from the camera using OpenCV and display it in real-time. The skills that were used in this were proficiency in Python Language and the library used were NumPy and OpenCV. AR Face Filter I developed an Augmented Reality (AR) face filter project that utilizes Unity and C# programming skills. This project involves creating a real-time interactive application that leverages the user's camera to add dynamic and engaging filters to their face. Through Unity and C#, I implemented features that enable facial detection, tracking, and the application of various filters in a seamless and visually appealing manner. The project showcases my proficiency in AR development, computer vision, and real-time image processing using the Unity platform. It represents a practical application of my skills in creating interactive and entertaining AR experiences. AR Plane Detection I developed a program in Unity using C# that demonstrates the ability to detect and differentiate between horizontal and vertical surfaces in an augmented reality (AR) context. This project focused on AR plane detection, wherein the software employs computer vision and Unity's AR capabilities to identify and classify surfaces as either horizontal or vertical. Through this project, I showcased my expertise in AR development, computer vision, and Unity programming, underscoring my ability to create immersive and context-aware AR applications that can interact with the user's environment. AR Object Placer I designed and implemented an AR Object Placer program using Unity and C# that leverages the user's camera to detect and interact with the surrounding environment. This project showcases the capability to identify real- world surfaces and allows users to place digital objects in their desired locations within their camera view. Through Unity and C#, I developed a user-friendly interface that combines computer vision and AR technology to enable precise and intuitive placement of digital objects. This project exemplifies my expertise in creating immersive and interactive augmented reality experiences that seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds. Gym Tracker I developed a Gym Tracker Application using Python, harnessing the capabilities of libraries such as MediaPipe, OpenCV, and NumPy. This innovative project involved utilizing a camera to track the user's workout routines in real-time. By analyzing the user's movements and gestures, the application accurately counted repetitions and provided feedback on performance at the conclusion of each workout session. This project not only demonstrated my proficiency in computer vision techniques but also showcased my ability to create practical solutions to everyday challenges in fitness and health tracking. Image Generator I developed an image generator program that generate images of fashion (Shirts, T-Shirts, Boots, Shoes, Jeans) I have implement the concept of Deep Learning in this project this project is basically made in Python language and I have used libraries like TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplot Lib. With the help of this project, I now know about the concepts of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model and its working. Extra  Curricular Activities Achievements in Sports 1.
