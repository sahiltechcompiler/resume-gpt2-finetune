Achievement:Awarded the Deans list for meritorious performance in Engineering exams in the 3rd,4th and 5th semester. 2021-2025 CGPA:8.94[Deans List] Huddard High School, Kanpur 12th (ISC) EXPERIENCE 2019 - 2020 Percentage-85.4 Data Analyst Intern Stratquo,Singapore Worked on a Market Basket Analysis project using the Apriori algorithm to mine transactional data, uncover frequent itemsets, and gain insights into consumer purchasing behaviors. The project focused on optimizing product placement and enhancing cross-selling strategies.Additionally,applied data analysis techniques to uncover the patterns,contributing to data-driven decision-making during this internship. July 2024- August 2024 (Remote) Data Science Intern Celebal Technologies Developed a spam email detection system using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. My work involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using accuracy and F1 score, achieving superior results with Neural Networks and XGBoost. May 2024- July 2024 (Remote) PROJECTS 1.Facenroll (Smart attendance assistant): Advanced Facial Recognition Attendance System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Keras for real-time face detection. This system collected and stored data on cloud platforms, capturing images and logging attendance with current date and time. Utilizing the openpyxl library, it exported attendance records to Excel spreadsheets. This project showcased my proficiency in Python, deep learning, and efficient data handling for attendance tracking. 2.Anomaly Detection for Network Traffic: Developed an Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in network traffic data, focusing on potential intrusions. Preprocessed data and evaluated the model using metrics such as ROC-AUC, achieving high precision. Utilized Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib for implementation.
