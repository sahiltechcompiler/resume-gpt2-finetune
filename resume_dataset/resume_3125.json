        "description": "Developed a system for detecting road lane lines in real-time using machine learning techniques. Collected and pre-processed image datasets for training and testing the model. Implemented image processing techniques such as edge detection, color filtering, and perspective transformation. Developed and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for lane detection. Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Integrated the lane detection model with a real-time video feed to detect lane lines. Collaborated with team members to optimize the model and improve detection accuracy.",
