Role: Internship on Manufacturing of Cylinders Duration: Aug 2023 to sept 2023       Academic Projects:  TITLE: EFFECT OF METAL FOAM PORE DENSITY GRADIENT FILLING ON HYDRODYNAMIC AND THERMAL PERFORMANCE In this work, two-dimensional numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the metal foam PPI gradient filling on heat transfer features inside the vertical channel. The domain examined in the study consists of a vertical channel in which the heater cum aluminium plate assemblage is positioned at the center and to augment heat transfer gradient metal foam PPI are placed on either side of the aluminium plate. The 10, 20, 30, 45 PPI metal foam with porosity 0.95, 0.9, 0.92 and 0.9 is considered in this study and are placed in gradient form vertically in the channel. EDUCATION QUALIFICATION  Completed Diploma in Mechanical Engineering in 2021 from Board of Technical Education, Karnataka with 75% aggregate  Completed B.E.in Mechanical Engineering in 2024 from Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belagavi with CGPA 6.69 aggregate.
