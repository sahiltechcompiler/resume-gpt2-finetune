        "description": "Developed a machine learning model for handwriting data to detect Alzheimers disease detection using regression models like Linear regression,XGB boost model,Adaboost model and Random Forest model. From this models Random forest model has the highest accuracy of 88.57, followed by XGB boost model having 85.71 and Adaboost has 82.85,we can conclude that Random forest is most suitable. Applied data analysis with NumPy and Pandas to clean and prepare complex datasets, facilitating model training.",
