Implemented Forward/Backpropagation, NN layers, Pooling/Flatten layers along with loss function. Ensured reasonable efficiency using vectorization of functions and matrix algebraic formulation of algorithms. Coded various Regression algorithms, Perceptron, Kernels and K-means Clustering in Numpy.",

Proved superiority of this model over additive Gaussian noise models using Chi-square goodness of fit. Implemented the algorithm to several practical applications such as edge detection and foreground extraction.",

Leveraged Mini-LLM-v2 to create a recommendation system that classifies data based on user prompts. Integrated LLaMa-2 API and Langchain Agent to automate SQL query generation and execution, facilitating efficient and accurate data validation. Initially used ChromaDB to store word embeddings but transitioned to a PostgreSQL instance for better scaling after deployment, with plans to extend the solution to streaming data using Apache Kafka.",
