I am looking for an entry-level position in Data Science or Data Analysis where I can use my skills to uncover insights and support decision-making. I am excited to apply my knowledge to help organizations solve real problems and achieve their goals. Experience Machine Learning Intern at IIT Kharagpur April 2024July 2024  Built machine learning models for Medical Visual Question Answering at IIT Kharagpur, and plotted graphs to gain insights.  Among the different models, MUTAN achieved the highest accuracy of 80.5% and the lowest loss of 0.56.  The MED-VQA dataset provided the best performance across all three models, with an average accuracy of 76.87%. Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation June 2024  Cleaned, modeled, and analyzed three datasets to identify the top 5 most popular content categories, with Animals ranking first, receiving 68,624 reactions.  May had the highest content postings, with a total of 1,954 posts. Projects 1. Text Insight Explorer: Unveiling Sentiments and Readability (GitHub: https://github.com/Koustavgg99/sentiment-analysis) Objective: This project evaluates text to uncover its emotional tone and readability, offering a view of its complexity and sentiment Analysis: The project cleans and tokenizes text, evaluates sentiment with word lists, and computes readability metrics like the Fog Index and average sentence length, with results on complex words and syllables summarized in Excel. Key Insights:  The average Positive Score is 6.77 and the average negative score is 1.97  The average Polarity Score is 0.65, indicating that most texts have a positive sentiment.  67.3% of the articles scored below the average Fog Index, indicating they are easier to read, while 32.7% scored above, reflecting greater complexity. Tools/Skills: Python, NLTK, Openpyxl, Sentiment Analysis, Readability Metrics, Data Processing 2. IPL complete insights using Power BI (GitHub: https://github.com/Koustavgg99/IPL-Dashboard-using-PowerBI) Objective: Developed an interactive IPL dashboard for visualizing and analyzing various aspects of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Analysis: I used Power BI to create parameterized charts and dynamic parameters, including simple to complex DAX, for detailed analysis Key Insights:  Virat Kohli is the highest scorer, while MI and CSK are the best teams with 5 titles each  Wankhede Stadium has hosted the most matches, with a total of 118 games being played there.  I analyzed player statistics and performance trends across seasons. Tools/Skills: Power BI, DAX, Data Visualization, Parameterized Charts 3. Ophthalmic Intelligence: using Vision AI for enhanced diagnosis (*currently ongoing) Team Members: Collaborating with three other team members Objective: We are developing machine-learning techniques to improve the diagnosis of Glaucoma. Analysis: Our team is developing and refining machine learning algorithms to analyze eye medical images. We aim to enhance Glaucoma detection accuracy by training these models with data and continuously improving them based on new insights and feedback. Key Insights:  We can differentiate between eyes with glaucoma and normal eyes with 95% accuracy.  We apply segmentation techniques to target the optic disk, achieving 98% accuracy in glaucoma identification.  By using Roboflow and applying segmentation techniques with Grad-CAM, we improved the quality of our eye image dataset and generated heatmaps for enhanced glaucoma identification. Tools/Skills: Machine Learning, Deep Learning (CNN, U-Net, Inception V3), Grad-CAM, Roboflow, Vision AI, Medical Image Analysis Education B.Tech, Computer Science & Engineering Heritage Institute Of Technology, Kolkata CGPA:9.24 HS (12th), Computer Science Krishnagar Collegiate School Score: 97.4% 2021-Present 2019-2021 Skills Programming Languages: Python, Java Data Analysis & Visualization: SQL, Statistical Analysis, Data Cleaning, Power BI, Tableau, Excel Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn Tools & Technologies: Git, Jupyter Notebook Awards & Certifications  I have completed the Data Science training certification from Internshala.  Certified in intermediate SQL by HackerRank.
