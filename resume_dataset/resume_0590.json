The project aims to automate the attendance process by accurately identifying individuals through facial features captured via images or video streams. Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, the system will analyze facial patterns, extract unique features, and match them against a database to mark attendance. The web application interface will allow users to easily access attendance records, manage data, and monitor real-time attendance status. With a focus on scalability, security, and user experience, this project seeks to revolutionize traditional attendance tracking methods in educational institutions or corporate settings.",
