Preprocessed retinal images using NumPy, OpenCV, and Pandas for resizing, black image removal, and data augmentation (rotation, flipping) to improve model robustness. Fine-tuned pre-trained models with custom Dense layers for classifying images into 'Normal,' 'Abnormal,' and 'Enhanced' categories. Trained models over 25 epochs with high validation accuracy using Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy. Plotted accuracy and loss graphs using Matplotlib to monitor model performance across epochs. Evaluated model performance with confusion matrices and classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for detailed reporting.",
