        "description": "OnDemand Automation Tool: It is a user interface by which internal users can put the request and get desired response based on the request via email. Ex: Execute Selenium/Appium tests, Get auto-generated template of code frameworks. Code Generator: To maintain the uniformity in code structure and save time in creating a base repository with some common utilities/properties (Ex: customExceptions, loggingConfig, DOCKERFILE etc), it automatically generates the Spring Boot/ Fast-API frameworks. Performance Test Automation: Developed a platform to execute locust(Python) based Performance Testing, UI/Headless mode perf test, that can up any number of workers for load generation. Used Kubernetes for automatic deployment, Helm as a package manager of K8. Automatic Jira Creation/Updation: Developed utility to automatically create or update tickets based on the cron job reports. It created 400+ tickets in just 6 months, which saved at-least 50+ man hours. Exam Maturity Framework (EMF): Created simulation reports on 200+ Functional/ Algorithmic checks that helped the team to detect hygiene/deficiency issues in advance. EMF is used to decide whether an exam is ready for production or not. Developed end to end automation scripts in python for content journey pipelines(including mongoDB, postgres databases and kafka). Developed an automated functional testing tool a APIs to get prompt functional and performance testing reports via email.",
