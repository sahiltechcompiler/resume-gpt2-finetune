Work Experience Machine Learning Research Internship SRM University, Mangalagiri, India Jul 2023 - Dec 2023  Collaborated with an assistant professor and a peer on advanced brain tumor detection research.  Conducted in-depth exploration of cutting-edge methodologies, including Self-Adaptive K-Means Clustering, Inception v2 Network, and IDRN-BTCC.  Implemented and analyzed various machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy and ef(cid:976)iciency of brain tumor detection. Projects TITLE: Password Generator DESCRIPTION: I have utilized the random module to generate robust, unique passwords by shuf(cid:976)ling characters and selecting random ones, ensuring heightened security. Developed and tested secure password generation scripts, reinforcing data protection measures and preventing unauthorized access. TITLE: Emotion Recognition - Undergraduate Research Oppurtunities Programme(UROP) DESCRIPTION: I conducted pioneering research in emotion recognition using Deep Neural Networks, implementing ResNet-50 and GoogleNet models on the CK+ dataset. This cutting-edge approach has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, mental health support, and targeted advertising by accurately discerning human emotions from facial expressions, gestures, and physiological signals..
