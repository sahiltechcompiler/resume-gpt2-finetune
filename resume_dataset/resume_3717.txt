Key features include product details (e.g., weight, visibility, MRP) and store information (e.g., size, location, establishment year). The model uses these features to predict sales prices based on trends and patterns observed in the historical data. The dataset is divided into training data with known sales prices and test data without them, where the model's predictions are evaluated. The ultimate goal is to optimize inventory and pricing strategies across outlets.
