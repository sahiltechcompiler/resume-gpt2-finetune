Utilized Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, model building, and visualization. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, employing algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting. Conducted model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE and R, achieving high accuracy and performance. The model was deployed on AWS, making it accessible for real-time predictions.",
