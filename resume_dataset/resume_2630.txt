Created 2 webpages for a specified project using React.js and contributed to backend development by working on middleware, routes, and model creation as part of a team of 4. PROJECTS Face Recognition Attendance System Using Python  This Python application automates attendance recording in an Excel spreadsheet by utilizing image recognition. It can capture images via webcam or process existing ones. Based on identified faces, the application automatically updates the spreadsheet, names, and other relevant data. This improves efficiency, reduces errors, and offers easy data storage including security for larger user bases. File Storage System using Hybrid Cryptography  This project leverages a hybrid cryptographic approach, combining the strengths of symmetric and asymmetric encryption. It utilizes an automatic logic generator to enhance security and employs Fernet, a recognized cryptographic tool, to achieve robust data protection. Predictive model for mental health analysis using ML  This project utilizes a 10-point scale to gauge an individual's mental well-being by incorporating a holistic approach by considering various influencing factors. These factors encompass a person's family history indicating potential genetic predispositions, their surrounding environment which can impact stress levels, and even biological sex as research suggests hormonal differences may play a role. By considering these diverse aspects, this project aims to provide a more comprehensive picture of an individual's mental health.
