I have a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and programming languages, and have honed my skills in machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics through projects and internships. Procient in Python, data visualization, MS Ofce, Excel, and PowerPoint, I also have excellent communication skills in English and Telugu. I am eager to apply my expertise in a dynamic work environment, contributing to innovative AI and ML projects. SKILLS Programming Languages: My SQL, Python, HTML, JavaScript, C++ Concepts: Data Structures and Algorithm, AI and Machine Learning, Computer Vision PROJECTS Chess Game Using Genetic Algorithm Articial Intelligence Project Aug 2023  Nov 2023 Python, pygame,HTML, CSS  Developed a fully autonomous chess game utilizing a genetic algorithm, where chess pieces move independently based on the algorithms strategic decisions.  The algorithm iteratively conducts selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement processes across a predened number of generations or until a convergence criterion is achieved, ultimately terminating when a satisfactory solution is identied. Chat bot for mental health support Machine learning Project Jan 2024- Mar 2024 Python, HTML, CSS, Java Script, MongoDB, PyTorch  Implemented natural language processing (NLP) to handle user inputs and generate responses using a neural network model.  Utilized PyTorch for building and training the neural network.  Leveraged MongoDB for efcient storage and retrieval of user interactions and data. Weather Report Python Jan 2022- June 2022 Python, Json,Turtle  Displayed real-time weather data including temperature in Celsius, humidity, and other meteorological parameters.  Integrated a real-time clock to show the current time in hh:mm:ssformat.  Implemented user input functionality to fetch weather reports for specic cities or locations.
