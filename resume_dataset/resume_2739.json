Curated a diverse dataset of yoga images, encompassing various poses and angles, to ensure the model's efficacy in recognizing diverse body positions. Implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features from yoga images and accurately identify key body landmarks for precise pose estimation. Employed transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., TensorFlow, VGG16) to enhance model performance and expedite training. Designed and implemented the frontend of the local application using React.js, HTML, and CSS to facilitate user interaction and visualization.",
