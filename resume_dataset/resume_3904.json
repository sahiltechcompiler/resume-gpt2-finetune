This project facilitates online learning, including features such as user authentication, course management, content delivery. In this Web-app, you can create new courses, modules, and users. You can assign these modules to instructors and students. There are three roles: Students can only view and complete course material, Instructors can create and manage course content, and Admins have full access including user management and system settings. Implemented JWT Web-token for encryption and decryption purposes and used Redux Toolkit for state management.",
