Eager to contribute to cutting-edge mechatronics projects by utilizing professional skills and academic knowledge. EDUCATION UNDERGRADUATE Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science 07/2022 - Present, Course B.Tech Mechatronics Engineering DIPLOMA Nettur Technical Training Foundation (NTTF) 07/2018 - 04/2021, Course Diploma in Mechatronics Engineering 7.3 CGPA 7.64 CGPA CERTIFICATES Product Design and Manufacturing NPTEL NSDC - Level 4 Technician Instrumentation PERSONAL PROJECTS Dual Axis Solar Tracking System Designed and built a dual-axis solar tracking system that optimizes panel alignment for maximum energy capture while being cost-eective and well documented. Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) Implemented an Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) project, which enhanced warehouse eciency by automating inventory management, improving storage space use, and expediting retrieval operations, resulting in considerable cost savings and increased productivity. Design and Development Of Wipedroid Led the design and development of WipeDroid, a unique table cleaning system that uses robots and articial intelligence to disinfect restaurant tables autonomously, assuring hygiene compliance, improving client safety, and simplifying cleaning processes for more productivity. Design and Development Of Exam Hall Proctoring Bot Designed and built a test Hall Proctoring Bot that uses AI and computer vision technologies to monitor test halls, detect suspicious conduct, and assure academic integrity, improving examination speed and fairness while adhering to security protocols. Research and Analysis Of Slam Algorithm For Turtlebot3 Using ROS Framework Our study compared G-mapping and Hector SLAM for Turtlebot3 in ROS, revealing G-mapping's superior map accuracy due to reduced distortion from high-speed movement, although Hector SLAM showed greater robustness. Improvement suggestions include addressing navigation setup issues to enhance eciency for both methods. nandheeswaran5355@gmail. com 9944287804 Coimbatore SKILLS C, C++ Python Autocad Solid Works Fusion 360 PLC Programming 3D Printing CNC Train Pneumatics and Hydraulics LANGUAGES Tamil Native or Bilingual Prociency English Full Professional Prociency INTERESTS Robotics Automation ROS Designing
