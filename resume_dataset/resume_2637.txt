Possess good communication skills and have an eye for detail. Flexible to work in any environment as required. Work Experience Undergraduate Research Oppurtinies(UROP) 1.Comparative Study of Data Collection Techniques in WSN:- Clustering vs Tree based approaches:- .Evaluated clustering and tree-based data collection techniques in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for energy efficiency, network lifetime, scalability, and data accuracy. Compared the trade-offs and optimal conditions to guide method selection for specific WSN applications. Key findings: Clustering-Based Approaches:-Conserves energy by reducing communication distance, though cluster heads deplete energy faster; extends network lifetime through periodic re-election; and is highly scal- able with easy restructuring. Tree-Based Approaches:-Optimizes multi-hop paths for energy efficiency; network lifetime depends on root and intermediate nodes; moderate scalability; high data accuracy with fewer aggregation points but increased traffic.
