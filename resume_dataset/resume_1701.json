        "description": "Implemented a classic Snake Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a snake controlled by arrow keys, with the objective of eating food pellets to grow longer. The snake's movement increases in speed as it consumes food, posing a challenge to the player. Basic level progression logic is incorporated, where the difficulty level increases by 5 score increments. This project honed my skills in front-end web development, particularly in JavaScript game development. It showcases my ability to create interactive and engaging web applications while employing fundamental programming concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and game logic implementation.",
