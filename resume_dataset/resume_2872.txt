Implemented user roles: Job Seekers, Job Providers, and Admin, with secure user authentication.Leveraged Djangos ORM, authentication system, and admin panel for robust backend development.  Tools/Technologies : Django (backend), DB-browser(for database management) PROJECTS Credit Card Recommendation  Employed demographic classification, Used spending behavior analysis, Segmented customers efficiently.  Identified key target groups for personalized credit card recommendations, Designed a Power BI dashboard featuring Jan 2024 key performance indicators KPIs and utilized DAX formulas to create dynamic calculations and enhance data analysis. Insights to Identify the Best Amazon Merchants Aug 2024  Cleaned and extracted key seller data using SQL and Power BI. Analyzed and segmented sellers based on interactions, product counts, and rating metrics.  Using Power BI, I identified the top 200 best-performing sellers and provided actionable insights, supporting decision-making through interactive visualizations. Tools used:- SQL, Power BI, DAX, Data Visualization Election Results Analysis  Scraped and extracted election results from the Election Commission of India's website using Beautiful Soup.  Built and analyzed datasets with Python and Excel, Leveraged statistical and analytical models for insights.  Developed Power BI dashboards featuring KPIs, filters, and visual elements like pie charts.  Tools/Technologies: Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Data Visualization: Power Bi, Excel Jun 2024 PUBLICATIONS An Empirical Study of Precision Agriculture Link  This Research paper, published in IEEE Xplore, In this research, I developed and implemented statistical models for plant leaf disease detection using a leaf dataset.  After performing feature extraction, I employed classification algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, and also used ensemble methods. By using ensemble methods, model accuracy increases from 78% to 90%.  Furthermore, we utilized MATLAB to implement five deep learning models and achieved a highest accuracy of 97%. CERTIFICATES Supervised Machine learning certification from IBM ACHIEVEMENTS Achieved 5-star rating in SQL on HackerRank Published a research paper on precision agriculture at the IEEE Conference.
