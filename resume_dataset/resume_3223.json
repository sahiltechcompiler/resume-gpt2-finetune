    "summary": "I am currently pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science engineering at Manipal University Jaipur. My professional journey includes internships at esteemed organizations, where I have honed my skills and contributed significantly to various projects. At Good Host Spaces, India's largest student housing group backed by Goldman Sachs and Warburg Pincus Inc., I played a pivotal role in facilitating over 7,000 allotments across three major projects. This experience helped me to develop a deep understanding of large-scale operations and project management. In addition, I interned with Vestas, a leading MNC, pioneer in wind energy, head office in Denmark. During my tenure, I collaborated with the sales management and operations team for the APAC region, where I was instrumental in supporting the bidding process for offshore projects in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and India. This role enhanced my expertise in strategic planning and international business operations. Besides, it also helped me to understand the office work culture, team work & collaboration.",
