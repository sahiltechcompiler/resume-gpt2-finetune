        "name": "Parkinson Disease Prediction",
        "description": "Performed data cleaning on a dataset comprising numerical features extracted from voice samples of both healthy and parkinsons afflicted individuals. Trained seven different ML based classifiers and carried out hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. Evaluated performance of all the trained models and achieved the best accuracy at 97 percent and recall at 94 percent. Explored the use of ParselMouth library to interact with a signal processing software called Praat. Utilised the library to extract numerical features from voice samples. Created a web application using the Flask framework which enables the user to upload voice recordings and get the predictions from the model.",

Applied video transformations using OpenCV on the video feed to display facial bounding boxes and name of the recognised individual. Implemented a MySQL database which stores the images and attendance records. Created an interface for administrators to view attendance logs and to add or delete students data.",

Demonstrated effectiveness of Naive Bayes and Multi Layer Perceptron classifiers in spam detection systems. The best model achieved accuracy of 0.98 percent on validation dataset. Explored the data visualisation techniques used for text data like word clouds to help develop a better understanding of the dataset.",
