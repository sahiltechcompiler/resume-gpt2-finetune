        "description": "The project addresses the critical public health concern of air pollution, emphasizing the link between exposure to pollutants and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. It highlights the importance of reliable and real-time monitoring of air quality for health advisories and evidence-based policymaking. The research concludes that advanced machine learning techniques, especially boosting algorithms, can effectively forecast AQI levels. The models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, demonstrated superior performance, explaining over 85 percent of AQI variability in testing data, providing a robust foundation for decision support systems and timely air pollution advisories.",

        "description": "This project aims to develop a robust software system for monitoring climatic conditions in real-time. The software will collect data from various sensors deployed across geographical locations and provide comprehensive insights into temperature, humidity, air pressure, and other relevant parameters. Users will access the system through a user-friendly interface, enabling them to visualise climatic conditions of the given location. The software will leverage advanced data analytics techniques to predict weather patterns and facilitate informed decision-making for various applications, including agriculture, transportation, and disaster management. By providing accurate and timely information, the Climatic Conditions Monitoring Software contributes to enhancing resilience and adaptability in the face of changing.Implemented using a combination of HTML, CSS for front-end design and interactivity, JavaScript for client-side scripting, and Flask as the back-end framework.",
