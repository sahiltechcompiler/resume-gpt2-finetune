This setup allowed for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting through dashboards and alerts, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and security. Additionally, the system supported centralized logging, security analytics, performance monitoring, business intelligence, and rapid IT issue resolution. I worked with senior scientists on the project development, troubleshooting and system optimization. Additionally, I participated in cybersecurity practices and technical workshops, enriching my understanding of IT infrastructure management.",
