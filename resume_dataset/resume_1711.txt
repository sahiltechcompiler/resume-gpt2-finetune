AGRIMA GOEL Hapur, India agrimagoel10@gmail.com 7455993022 PROFILE I'm Agrima Goel, an undergraduate student aspiring to become an IT professional, passionate about machine learning, deep learning, data analytics, and database management. Skilled in leveraging data science for practical solutions, I'm eager to contribute my evolving expertise to dynamic projects. EDUCATION Manipal University Jaipur (2021-2025) Bachelor of Technology : Data Science and Engineering Delhi Public School Hapur : Mathematics, English, Physics, Chemistry, Fine arts, Physical education TECHNICAL SKILLS  Python  Java  SQL  C Programming  Machine Learning Frameworks  Data Analysis tools  Database Management Systems  Data Visualization SKILLS  Analytical Thinking  Adaptability  Good Communication  Multi-tasking  Team Collaboration PROJECTS  Wine Quality Prediction :  Created a wine quality prediction system using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. Employed PCA for dimensionality reduction and implemented Nave Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering. Sharpened data preprocessing skills and gained insights into wine quality factors, showcasing proficiency in data science tools and diverse machine learning techniques.  Handwritten Digit Classification:  Developed a high-performance deep learning model for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that achieved superior accuracy through optimized hyperparameters and enhanced generalization techniques. The project showcases the efficacy of neural networks in image classification, particularly for practical applications like optical character recognition.  Wholesale Management System:  Developed a SQL-based prototype for a Wholesale Management System to manage customers, suppliers, products, payments, and transactions. Designed a database schema with five tables and implemented features to add/update details and view transactions. Utilized SQL and Oracle Database for efficient data management. While this prototype lacks features for real-life use, it shows potential as a cost- effective solution for small businesses. Offline transaction management simplifies use, but further development is needed for practical application.
