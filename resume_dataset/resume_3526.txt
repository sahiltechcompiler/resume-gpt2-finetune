KEY EXPERTISE Data Science Machine Learning Deep Learning Java Python Computer Vision SQL Excel EDUCATION Manipal University Jaipur B.Tech. - CSE | CGPA: 7.90 / 10 FIITJEE, Visakhapatnam 12th | BIEAP | Percentage: 84 / 100 Sri Chaitanya School, Visakhapatnam 10th | CBSE | Percentage: 92 / 100 PROJECTS 2021 - 2025 2021 2019 Data Integration and Analytics Automation using SQL and Power BI 15 Jun, 2024 - 05 Jul, 2024 Key Skills: SQL Power BI Microsoft Excel EDA Developed a robust data integration pipeline using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) in conjunction with .NET technologies. The pipeline will automate the extraction of data from both Excel spreadsheets and SQL Server databases, transforming and loading it into a unified data warehouse. Once integrated, Power BI is leveraged for generating insightful analytical reports and visualizations. This project aims to streamline data workflows, enhance data-driven decision-making capabilities, and optimize operational efficiencies through advanced analytics.
