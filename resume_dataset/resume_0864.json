The domain examined in the study consists of a vertical channel in which the heater cum aluminium plate assemblage is positioned at the center and to augment heat transfer gradient metal foam PPI are placed on either side of the aluminium plate. The 10, 20, 30, 45 PPI metal foam with porosity 0.95, 0.9, 0.92 and 0.9 is considered in this study and are placed in gradient form vertically in the channel.",
