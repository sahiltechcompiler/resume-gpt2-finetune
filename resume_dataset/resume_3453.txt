EDUCATION Oct 2021  Present Mar 2019 Mar 2020 Mar 2017  Mar 2018 PROJECTS MANIPAL UNIVERITY JAIPUR B. Tech in IT, 7.85 The Assembly of God Church School AISSCE, CBSE, 81.3% The Assembly of God Church School AISSE, CBSE, 87.6% E-Commerce Website Web Development project replicating the website of SuperKicks using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL. Digit Recognition System This project trains a neural network on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits, using a model with dense and flattened layers, and evaluates its performance on test data. Custom images are also predicted using the trained model. Libraries used - Tensorflow, Matplotlib, NumPy, OpenCV Image Classification ML project to classify images and identify overfitting then apply techniques to mitigate it, including data augmentation and dropout. Libraries used - Tensorflow, Matplotlib, NumPy, PIL, Pathlib Image Caption Generator This project develops a model to generate image captions using a VGG16 CNN for image features and an LSTM RNN for text generation, trained on an flickr_8k dataset and evaluated with BLEU scores. Libraries used - Tensorflow, Matplotlib, NumPy, PIL, tqdm, nltk SKILLS C JAVA Python Data Analysis Computer Vision Natural Language Processing Data Structures and Algorithms Data Science Object Oriented Programming Anaconda GIT MySQL Social Media Management Communication Marketing VOLUNTARY EXPERIENCE Dec 2021  May 2023 Promotional Head Strategically planned & promoted over 5 large-scale events including: BNDxRPM SAE MOTORSPORT EVENT with over 14,000 views across various platforms.
