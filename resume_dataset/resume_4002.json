I created RESTful APIs for financial data processing and management, developed secure authentication and authorization mechanisms using JWT and OAuth, and integrated various third-party financial APIs for real-time data fetching and transaction processing. I implemented robust error handling and logging to ensure application stability, utilized PostgreSQL/MySQL for data storage and management, and ensured data integrity through the use of ACID properties and database transactions. Additionally, I conducted performance optimization to handle large volumes of financial transactions efficiently and deployed backend services on cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure for scalability and reliability. I collaborated with frontend developers to ensure seamless integration between frontend and backend systems and adhered to best practices in code versioning, testing, and CI/CD. Technologies used included Python, Java, Node.js, Django, Flask, Spring Boot, Express.js, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Jenkins, and cloud services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.",
