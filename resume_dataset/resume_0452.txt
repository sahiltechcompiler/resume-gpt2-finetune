Key Skills Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Image Processing, Deep Learning, Data Augmentation, Computer Vision, Confusion Matrix, Model Evaluation, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Transfer Learning, NumPy, Matplotlib Designed a deep learning system to detect and classify diabetic retinopathy stages using transfer learning with models like MobileNet and ResNet. Preprocessed retinal images using NumPy, OpenCV, and Pandas for resizing, black image removal, and data augmentation (rotation, flipping) to improve model robustness. Apr 2024 - May 2024 Diabatic Retinopathy Det ection Fine-tuned pre-trained models with custom Dense layers for classifying images into 'Normal,' 'Abnormal,' and 'Enhanced' categories. Jan 2024 - Apr 2024 Trained models over 25 epochs with high validation accuracy using Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy. Plotted accuracy and loss graphs using Matplotlib to monitor model performance across epochs. Evaluated model performance with confusion matrices and classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for detailed reporting. AWS Academy Cloud Foundations is intended for students who seek an overall understanding of cloud computing concepts, independent of specific technical roles. It provides a detailed overview of cloud concepts, AWS core services, security, architecture, pricing, and support.
