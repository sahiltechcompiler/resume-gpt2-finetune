The project aims to automate the attendance process by accurately identifying individuals through facial features captured via images or video streams. Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, the system will analyze facial patterns, extract unique features, and match them against a database to mark attendance. The web application interface will allow users to easily access attendance records, manage data, and monitor real-time attendance status. With a focus on scalability, security, and user experience, this project seeks to revolutionize traditional attendance tracking methods in educational institutions or corporate settings. Number Plate Detection Key Skills: Algorithms YOLOv8 OCR tensorflow RCNN Opencv Machine Learning datasets accuracy Image Processing Computer Vision teamwork time management Creating a Number Plate Detection System utilizing advanced image processing and computer vision techniques. The project aims to automatically identify and extract number plates from images or video feeds captured by surveillance cameras or mobile devices. By applying cutting-edge algorithms, the system will locate and isolate number plate regions within the captured images, allowing for accurate recognition and extraction of alphanumeric characters. The web-based application interface will enable users to upload images or live video streams for real-time number plate detection and retrieval of relevant information. With a focus on efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, this project aims to enhance vehicle tracking, parking management, and law enforcement operations. heart disease diagnostic analysis Key Skills: Data Analysis Data Cleaning ETL Tableau python Microsoft Excel Certainly! Heres a revised paragraph focusing on the analysis aspect: The Heart Disease Diagnosis project involved analyzing medical data to identify risk factors for heart disease. Using Python, I collected and cleaned data, performed exploratory data analysis with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover patterns and correlations. I engineered features to enhance the analysis and used Python to develop visualizations. Tableau was employed to create interactive dashboards that presented key insights and trends. This analysis provided valuable information on risk factors and trends, aiding in better understanding and early identification of heart disease.
