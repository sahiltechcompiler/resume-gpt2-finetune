User have to log in to our platform, enter their start destination and end destination, and find rates and availability of vehicles. Once they have finalized, they can book the vehicle there itself. This will save their time, effort, and money since they know which platform is offering cheaper rides and faster availability of the cab. Also published a paper on this project at IRJMETS (International Research Journal of Modernization in Engineering Technology and Science).",
