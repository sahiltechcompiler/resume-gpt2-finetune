By leveraging frequency domain embedding and encryption techniques, the algorithm ensures secure and imperceptible data transmission. Comparative analysis with the traditional Least Significant Bit (LSB) method demonstrates improved robustness and perceptual quality, making Fourier Transform steganography a promising solution for secure communication needs.
