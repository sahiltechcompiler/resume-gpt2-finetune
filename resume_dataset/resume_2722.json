        "description": "Worked on Web development. Worked with Software Engineering Systems (SWES) team to develop a web application using Angular and Golang to manage 94 jenkins controllers to reduce the workload on software support teams and save time for jenkins users. Developed a notification banner that appears at the top of the page to alert users whenever there are updates regarding downtime or maintenance of the application. Developed a search bar to auto-fill user details based on username and add checkboxes to select multiple controllers. Implemented Golang REST APIs to authorize employees to restart controllers using POST and DELETE requests. Created UpdateVersion method to update jenkins controller version according to regions via a PUT API request. Developed unit test for UpdateVersion method using GORM and SQLMock without relying on external database. Managed Makefile tasks including linting, testing, build and push docker images and performed database cleanup. Utilized Jenkins and Docker for CI/CD, achieving an 97.17% reduction in docker image size optimization from 1.47GB to 42.7MB through efficient multi-stage builds, resulting in vast deployment speed and resource efficiency. Developed a public jenkins shared library for Devops teams to send notifications if the pipeline build successfully and clean the workspace regardless of pipeline outcome. Tested new Bitbucket server by git clone, push, open PR, merge PR automatically using python script and verify jenkins with git plugin and server integration for scm during data center migration from Wilmington to Ashburn. Deployed a web application on Kubernetes, providing secure global accessibility exclusively for Analog devices employees, ensuring efficient and easy access for the organization work.",
