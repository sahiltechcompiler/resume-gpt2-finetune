To develop the ML model, feature engineering, data pre-processing, and ML algorithms were utilized. The data were pre-processed, and feature engineering was performed to transform the data into a suitable format for our model. Then the data were divided into training and testing sets to train and evaluate our model's performance. Various ML algorithms were utilized to optimize the model's accuracy and efficiency.",

The scope includes numerous important areas: i) Data collection and preprocessing: A sizable dataset of tweets classified as hate speech and regular text will be gathered. After that, the data will be cleansed, formatted for use with sentiment analysis tools, and any unnecessary information will be removed in order to prepare it for analysis. ii) Sentiment analysis and feature engineering: To extract features from the text data that capture emotional tones and signs of hate speech, we will investigate various sentiment analysis techniques. We will also investigate further feature engineering techniques to find pertinent features that set hate speech apart.",
