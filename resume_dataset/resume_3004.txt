I possess a strong foundation in programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, Dart, etc., along with a passion for solving complex problems and a commitment to continuous learning. I have key interest in Machine Learning, Java, and Android Development and wish to gain experience with the same. EDUCATION CGPA: 9.46/10  4th year Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science 2020  2024 Sun Valley International School, CBSE Class 12th - 96%, 10th - 94% Till 2020 PCM WORK EXPERIENCE Machine Learning Intern Indian Oil Corporation Limited February 2024 - April 2024  Analyzed and visualized large datasets using QlikSense to uncover patterns and trends.  Employed NLP tools like Insight Advisor for processing unstructured text data and extracting insights.  Developed machine learning models tailored to project requirements.  Integrated machine learning models with QlikSense for dynamic decision-making.  Implemented a feedback mechanism to improve model accuracy based on user interactions. PROJECTS Stock Prediction using Machine Learning | Python, Anaconda, Jupyter, Streamlit  Developed a Python tool using various libraries to assist new investors entering the market.  Implemented a machine learning model, specifically LSTM, to predict stock prices based on dynamic behavior.  Utilized real-time data from APIs such as Yahoo Finance and Alphavantage, focusing on US stocks in the early stages of development.  Created a web application using the Streamlit in Python for easy accessibility and user interaction and hosted it for end users. library  The project's common nature allowed for valuable learning experiences from peers and industry experts. TECHNICAL SKILLS Intent Classification Task using Machine Learning | Python, Flask, Anaconda, Jupyter, TensorFlow, Transformers, Docker Chatly: A Flutter and Firebase Project | Flutter, Firebase  Created a cross-platform communication using Flutter and Firebase  Implemented secure Google login and real-time features (last seen, blue ticks, timestamps)  Implemented robust profile management  Elevated user experience with intuitive unread message markers  Ensured efficient communication and enhanced user engagement across devices.  Developed an intent classification system using machine learning algorithms to categorize user queries into predefined categories or intents.  Explored and analyzed various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and BERT, to identify the most suitable model for the task.  Conducted feature engineering to extract relevant features from the text data, such as bag-of-words representations or word embeddings.  Implemented and trained the selected model, fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Languages: C++, SQL, Java, HTML5/CSS3, Python, Dart Libraries and Frameworks: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, TensorFlow, Flask, Scikit-learn, Transformers, Locust, Torch, Streamlit Developer Tools: GitHub, Google Cloud Platform, VS Code, Canva, IntelliJ IDEA, Anaconda, QlikSense, Firebase, Docker TRAININGS AND CERTIFICATIONS  30 Days of Google Cloud  A Complete Guide to Java Programming  Google DevFest ACHIEVEMENTS  Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners  Modern HTML & CSS  Python Complete Course for Python Beginners  Currently, I hold a position among the top 10 students in my college in my department.  My victories span various competitions, including science quizzes, general knowledge quizzes, videography, and photography contests.  Throughout my schooling from 6th to 12th grade, I received scholarships each year for outstanding academics.  Additionally, I achieved recognition as one of the top 10 rank holders in my zone for the International Mathematics Olympiad organized by the Science Olympiad Foundation.
