Shashwat Singh Django Backend Developer | Penetration Tester +91-9559830090 hzshashwat@gmail.com LinkedIn | Github | Portfolio Experience Backend Developer Blockchain Research Lab Dec. 2022 - Present 1 yr 4 months Developed projects utilizing Django, DRF, and RESTful APIs, incorporating features such as socket programming, payment integrations, and machine learning. Demonstrated leadership skills as a team leader, effectively managing and mentoring 5-10 developers to achieve project objectives. Responsible for overseeing the security, testing, and deployment processes for all projects within the organization, ensuring quality and efficiency throughout the development lifecycle. Projects VidyutKavach A Cyber-Secure Web-Based Energy Management System Implemented a multi-layered security approach, utilizing an MQTT broker server for IoT authentication, Network-Based Signature IDPS, Host-Based Heuristic IDPS, and SOAR technology. Integrated robust data analysis and visualization models to provide real-time insights into energy production, consumption, and export, enhancing decision- making processes. Designed with a cloud/hybrid setup capability, making it highly cost-effective for small and medium-scale IPPs (Independent Power Producers), ensuring scalability and efficiency. AnubhavSanraksha An Autonomous Learning Intrusion Detection and Prevention System Deployed heuristic IDPS on host systems to meticulously scan and thwart malicious packets, significantly fortifying network defenses against potential threats. Engineered a dynamic signature generation system, enabling the creation of new signatures tailored to swiftly identify newly detected malicious packets. Seamlessly integrated these newly generated signatures into a network-based signature IDPS, facilitating continuous training and optimization of detection capabilities, particularly effective against 0-day attacks. FauxDNS Deceptive DNS for MITM Attack Simulation Fake DNS Server: Engineered a DNS server running on personal laptops to deceive smartphones, redirecting their TCP traffic to the laptop for analysis. Proxy Server: Designed a server to manage traffic redirection between smartphones and remote servers, enabling seamless interception and inspection of network traffic. Fake Certificate Authority: Created a robust tool for generating TLS certificates, ensuring that smartphones trust the deceptive network setup, facilitating comprehensive security assessment.
