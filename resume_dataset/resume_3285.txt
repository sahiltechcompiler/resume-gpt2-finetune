Certicates An Introduction to Programming the Internet of Things (IOT), Coursera | Arduino, Raspberry Pi, C, Python  Design, create, and deploy a fun IoT device using Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms. In this Specialization covers embedded systems, the Raspberry Pi Platform, and the Arduino environment for building devices that can control the physical world. Career Essentials in Generative AI ,Microsoft and Linkedin | AI, GANs, AI Ethics, CoPilot  This course was a great learning experience for me, as I gained a solid foundation in generative AI, such as natural language generation, neural network and data augmentation. There was also a great explanation of the ethical approach we should put in our AI models.This was a very informative course and I look forward to apply what I learned in my future projects. STUDENT'S ID CARD : VIVEK KUMAR Name Roll I Adm.
