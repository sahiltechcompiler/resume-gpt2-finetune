Developed a hybrid CNN-RNN model for fake news detection, integrating insights from the literature survey, and achieved 52% accuracy. Enhanced model performance using Word2Vec embeddings for semantic understanding. Projects Spam Review Detection Using Deep Learning  Engineered a spam review detection model by concatenating text-based and feature-based models, analyzing over 10,000 Amazon reviews, achieving 90.58% accuracy.  Implemented BERT embeddings and a BiLSTM architecture to capture contextual information and identify spam- like patterns.  Developed a feature-based BiLSTM model incorporating sentiment analysis and other textual features, resulting in a 15% accuracy improvement. Incorporated temporal features to enhance understanding of review dynamics. Flight Delay Analysis  Analyzed flight delays using FAAs Airline On-Time Statistics and Delay Causes Dataset.  Explored temporal trends, identified key factors contributing to delays, and investigated relationships between delay causes, carriers, and airports.  Utilized Python and data visualization techniques to derive actionable insights into airline delay patterns.
