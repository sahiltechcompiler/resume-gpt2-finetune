        "description": "The VGG-19 technology was employed to recognize the input image of the fruit. A standout feature of our project is its ability to accurately recognize fruits with over 90% precision, even when the input image is blurred. Significant changes have been implemented in the architecture of VGG-19 incorporating an unblurring layer after the first convolutional layer. This improvement led to an outstanding accuracy rate surpassing 90%.",
