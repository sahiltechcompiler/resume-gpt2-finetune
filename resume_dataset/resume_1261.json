Designed a highly accurate news categorization tool using NLP techniques, enabling real time classification of articles, with a throughput of over 1000 articles per hour. Used Open CV and Haar cascade algorithm to accurately detect face and eye with an accuracy of 97%. Implemented the Vision Transformer model for image classification by importing datasets, setting hyperparameters, applied data augmentation, created image patches, and developed the ViT classification model with an F1-score of 0.75. Created comprehensive visual reports using Power BI to track key performance indicators. Identifies key features in images through a process of data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and refinement.",
