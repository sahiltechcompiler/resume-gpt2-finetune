        "description": "The project aims to find potential Credit card fraud groups among a large number of financial transactions. In order to improve the efficiency of the framework, case reduction methods such as matching transaction detection and balance score filter are used to narrow down the list of potential ML accounts. Next by taking advantage of structural similarity, we can identify and group potential Credit card accounts. Our preliminary experimental results show a high degree of accuracy in detection of ML accounts.",
