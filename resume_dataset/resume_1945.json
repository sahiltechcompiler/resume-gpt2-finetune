        "description": "Collaborated with some of my classmates and Prof Prasanthi B, we developed a proposal for a Car Crash Detection System. This innovative tool utilizes deep learning and multi-modal data from dashboard cameras to create an efficient emergency road call service. The system automatically identifies traffic accidents, enabling prompt response and rescue operations by transmitting the information to emergency recovery agencies. Our research project boasts an impressive accuracy rate of 94, ensuring reliable and precise detection of car crashes.",
