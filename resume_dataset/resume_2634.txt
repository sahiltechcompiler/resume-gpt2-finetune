The project starts with collecting and preprocessing relevant datasets, including patient demographics and medical history. EDA is performed to identify patterns and relationships within the data, followed by feature engineering to enhance model performance. The XGBoost model is then trained and optimized, with its performance evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. This predictive model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes by providing a data-driven approach to assessing cervical cancer risk. Football League Key Skills: https://github.com/shreyabukinkere/Football-League The Football League Management System provides a structured and efficient way to manage the diverse and dynamic data associated with a football league. By leveraging a well-designed relational database schema, the system ensures that all aspects of the league are documented, accessible, and manageable, fostering better decision-making and operational efficiency.
