Collaborated with a team of data engineers to design and train learning model for data processing, testing and achieving a 15% reduction in false positive rates. Collected the dataset from cpcb website using the api key. Demonstrated expertise in data visualization using matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy and cartopy library for plotting Mumbai city with aqi Index on a global map.",
