        "description": "Developed the complete back-end service from scratch using Node.js. Created the complete code-base using industry standard MVC architecture, and wrote all controller codes for reducing load on database to reduce lag and cost by 30%. Used Express.js framework for the heavy-lifting of back-end code and used React.js for creating front- end of the application for easy state management. Used many javascript functionality for dry code for easy debugging and testing. Continously used postman and its collection and environment variables for creating easy structuring and fast testing of the back-end codes. Used MongoDB for database management, used Mongo's advanced aggregation pipelines to cluster and interconnect data objects increasing the database response. Added highly secure and reliable dependencies and use two tokens and cookies for better client experience and smooth service I've led a team of 6 developer and managed the complete project.",
