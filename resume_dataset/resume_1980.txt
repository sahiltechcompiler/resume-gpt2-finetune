Proficient in Python and C++ , I am well-equipped for roles that combine machine learning and data analysis. Work Experience Data Analysis Using Python-APSSDC Jun2023 - Sep 2023  During my 2-month internship at APSSDC as a Data Analysis Intern, I gained extensive experience in data analysis using Python. I learned to clean data, conduct exploratory data analysis, and perform critical tasks such as checking for null values, sorting, and grouping data. Additionally, I developed skills in using various data visualization techniques to effectively present analytical findings. Projects Predicting credit card customer segmentation Link to Demo Proposed a approach for predicting credit card customer segmentation by integrating binning techniques, decision tree analysis, and Naive Bayes classification. Preprocessed the dataset using binning, developed an interpretable decision tree model, and improved predictive accuracy with Naive Bayes. Validated on a real-world dataset, the method demonstrated effective customer segmentation, providing insights for targeted marketing and risk management in the financial industry Mental Health Prediction Using ML Link to Demo Conducted research to predict mood swings, a key indicator of mental health, using machine learning al- gorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes. Applied feature engineering and model validation techniques, including accuracy, F1-score, and recall, to develop high-accuracy prediction models. This research offers valuable insights for proactive mental health man- agement and intervention.
