SHYAM KUMAR REDDY KALLA (cid:211) +91-6301121482 kshyamrdy@gmail.com jathinshyam (cid:135) JathinShyam / JathinShyam EDUCATION SASTRA Deemed University Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence & Data Science) INTERNSHIP Rockfort Labs Machine Learning Intern 2020  2024 Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu Jun 2023  Aug 2023  Contributed to Predictive Maintenance by developing a robust Machine Learning algorithm for detecting anomalies of real-time IIoT sensors  Accuracy of nearly 98% for each boiler enhanced the decision-making.  Resulted in improved sensor reliability, optimizes maintenance strategies, and enhanced operational strategies. PROJECTS Recipe App | Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, Github Actions  Developed a Django-based Recipe app to efficiently create and manage recipes by Test Driven Development(TDD)  Constructed 58+ test cases for different scenarios to ensure its functionality, reliability, and accuracy.  Implemented advanced features such as recipe filtering, sorting, and searching to enable users to discover recipes based on their preferences and dietary requirements.  Integrated Docker for containerization, facilitating easy deployment and scalability across various environments, thus ensuring efficient application management and maintenance. Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio | Python, Deep Learning  Developed a Spectrum Sensing model using Deep Learning for Cognitive Radio by integrating CNN and LSTM called DetectNet  Contributed to improving classification accuracy in challenging wireless communication environments.  Implemented Signal modulation classification to enhance accuracy of 87%, particularly in low Signal-to-Noise (SNR) ratio in which the model outperformed traditional Energy Detector with accuracy of more than 5%. Customer Relationship Management | Python, Django, Bootstrap, MySQL, SMTP  Developed a Django-based CRM system to efficiently manage and maintain strong customer relationships, streamline communication, and enhance overall customer satisfaction  Implemented user authentication, customer management, contact tracking, and a task and reminder system.  By implementing this CRM system, businesses can effectively organize customer data, address customer queries promptly, and assign tasks to support leads.
