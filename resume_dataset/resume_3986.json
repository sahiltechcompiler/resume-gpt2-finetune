Collaborated with fellow interns and mentor to preprocess a raw dataset with records of a telecom company customers, overcoming ambiguity, ensuring data quality and relevance. Built machine learning models, initially achieving an accuracy of 72% using decision tree, improved the accuracy to 80% by hyperparameter tuning. Also used logistic regression and random forest, achieving accuracies over 80%, which can aid in formulation of strategies to retain customers at risk of churning.",
