Also developed the APIs for the Admin side, enabling them to view all incoming pickup requests and promptly update the request status as Accepted or Rejected, change scrap prices, and add new service locations. Created the API design and thoughtfully designed the entire system, carefully choosing the appropriate database for the application, considering all the system's functionalities and scalability. Implemented rate limiting to prevent any misuse of APIs and carefully protect our servers from receiving too many unnecessary requests from a single user. Successfully reduced the development cost as much as possible and published the app on Google Play Store.",
