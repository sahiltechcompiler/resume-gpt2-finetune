Refined particle position calculations with Zarkhov functions; achieved a 35% increase in algorithm efficiency and a 25% reduction in computation time, delivering substantial time savings for the data analysis team.  Optimized localized exploration by partitioning the search space and assigning particles to subspaces, resulting in a 40% increase in solution space coverage. Projects Weather API Python Project| Python, Weather API Project Link  Developed a Python application to provide real-time temperature information, achieving 95% accuracy and a response time of less than 2 seconds.  Functionality:  Takes a city name as input and fetches the current temperature using an online weather API,with a 99.9% uptime. Path Finding Using AI Algorithm| Python, AI Algorithms, Graph Concepts Project Link  Designed a project utilizing the A* algorithm to determine the shortest path between cities, reducing computation time by 40% compared to traditional methods.  A* explores 50% fewer nodes than Dijkstras algorithm on average, increasing efficiency in route calculation.  Functionality:  Processes a dataset with over 100 city names, latitudes, and longitudes.  Forms a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) that reduces the graph by more than 60% and calculates the shortest path between specified source and destination cities and represents cities on a map using Folium.. Privacy Preserving Analytics| HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Data Analysis Concepts  Built a comprehensive platform for secure data handling and visualization.  Functionality:  Defined 2 distinct roles for data owners and data analysts.  Directed the secure upload process for data owners, ensuring CSV files are uploaded in the Data Owners tab; enabled data Project Link analysts to generate encrypted insights, enhancing data security and accuracy by 25%.  Ensured data privacy and integrity through encryption, achieving 100% data protection.  Provided 3 types of insightful data visualizations.
