Projects Glaucoma Detection Using Deep Learning Algorithms (Research)  This project focuses on glaucoma detection using a deep learning algorithm.  The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with residual blocks has shown promise in accurately identifying glaucoma based on retinal images.  The project aims to improve the detection and clinical judgment of glaucoma, potentially leading to better diagnosis and treatment. Click here Student Management Report System Click here  Designed and implemented a Student Report Management System in C++, emphasizing file handling techniques.  This system efficiently handles student details, enabling users to add, modify, delete, and display individual or all student records.  Notably, it includes a feature to identify and showcase the top three performers in Semester III.  This project underscores my proficiency in C++ programming and practical data management solutions. Loan Default Prediction  This project focuses on developing predictive models to identify the likelihood of loan defaults.  By leveraging machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and random forest, we aim to create robust and accurate tools for assessing credit risk.  Our approach includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.  The logistic regression model provides interpretability by highlighting key factors influencing default probability, while the random forest model enhances predictive accuracy through ensemble learning.  This project aims to provide financial institutions with reliable models to improve decision-making and reduce financial risk.
