Executed data preprocessing which included cleaning and normalization, to ensure datasets were primed for insightful analysis and effective visualization. Projects Predictive Loan Approval Modeling with Machine Learning Mar 2019 - Jan 2021  Led a machine learning project to predict loan approvals, utilizing datasets from Kaggle. This involved spearheading the end-to-end development and implementation of predictive models.  Enhanced model accuracy by applying data preprocessing and various algorithmic approaches, coupled with rigorous evaluation using train-test splits to refine data mining and machine learning methodolo- gies. Advanced Plant Disease Detection with ML Ensemble Aug 2023 - Dec 2023  Directed a research initiative on plant leaf classification, enhancing predictive precision by employing an ensemble of machine learning models for distinguishing between healthy and diseased specimens.  Pioneered a unique method by incorporating the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to boost decision-level accuracy, achieving results on par with established models through a blend of referenced techniques and recent innovations. College Bus Reservation Jan 2024 - May 2024  Developed a college bus reservation system using C++ and OOPs concepts.  The application features an admin module for adding and deleting number of buses, and a student module for booking buses and other services.
