Projects  Electricity Billing System Project: Implemented Developed an academic project using Java for the front-end and MySQL for database management. functionalities for managing billing processes, including customer information, and transaction records. Ensured seamless communication between the front-end interface and the MySQL database for efficient data retrieval and management  Amazon and Netflix clones: Developed an Amazon clone website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for front-end development. Implemented a responsive user interface, product listing with categories, search functionality, user authentication, shopping cart management, and checkout process simulation. Utilized JavaScript for dynamic content updates and interactions, ensuring a seamless user experience similar to the original Amazon platform. Developed a Netflix clone website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for front-end development. Implemented features including user authentication, content categorization, dynamic content loading for video streaming, and playback controls. Integrated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to replicate Netflixs user interface and functionality, providing a realistic streaming experience for users.  Climate Xplorer Developed a dynamic weather forecasting website named Climate Xplorer. Leveraging Pythons Streamlit framework, We managed both front-end and back-end functionalities to ensure a seamless user experience. We implemented robust security protocols, including password hashing and a secure password reset mechanism via email verification. By integrating OpenWeather and OpenMeteo APIs, We enabled real-time and future weather data retrieval, enhancing the sites analytical capabilities. Additionally, We used stream-lit functions to optimize the websites interface and interactivity, contributing to its overall usability and performance.  Course Recommendation System Developed a Course Recommendation System utilizing machine learning techniques to enhance user experience in discovering relevant courses based on their preferences. Implemented sophisticated preprocessing techniques to clean and structure raw data, ensuring robust implementation with real-world datasets. Integrated HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly interface, optimizing accessibility and usability for end-users. This project not only facilitated efficient course discovery but also underscored my proficiency in data preprocessing, machine learning, and web development.  Case-based projects in the Finlatics Business Analyst program. Done three case-based projects using real-time data using Excel and Power BI tools for business development and for better visualization of data to deal with problems.
