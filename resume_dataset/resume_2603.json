Utilized NLP frameworks and tools such as Spacy, NLTK, and Hugging Face Transformers to implement intent recognition, entity extraction, and context management, achieving an intent accuracy of 60%. Implemented machine learning models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2) for generating dynamic responses, resulting in a BLEU score of 55 and enhancing conversational quality. Integrated with backend systems and external APIs for real-time data retrieval, reducing query handling time and improving the chatbots overall efficiency.",
