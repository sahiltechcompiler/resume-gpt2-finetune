        "description": "Utilizes deep learning-based object detection models such as Faster R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once) to identify bikers and their helmets within images or video frames. Employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify detected bikers as either helmeted or helmetless, based on the presence or absence of a helmet. Enables real-time monitoring of bikers in live video streams, facilitating immediate intervention by authorities when helmetless bikers are detected. Focuses on optimizing detection accuracy and robustness to variations in lighting conditions, biker poses, and backgrounds to minimize false positives and false negatives.",
