        "description": "Broomees is revolutionizing the lives of domestic workers by providing them with dignified employment opportunities, fair wages, and essential benefits. The organization has significantly increased the salaries of domestic workers through their platform and goes beyond financial support by offering health insurance, interest-free loans, female hygiene products, and transportation assistance, which greatly enhance workers' quality of life. The company's training programs in cooking, cleaning, and babysitting address the gap left by conventional education, equipping workers with valuable skills and improving their professional prospects. This approach not only uplifts individual workers but also meets the needs of customers seeking reliable and professional domestic help. Under Niharika's leadership, Broomees has demonstrated a commitment to social impact and operational excellence. Their work is not only transforming the domestic work sector but also setting a precedent for how businesses can drive systemic change.",
