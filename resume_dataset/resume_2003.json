        "description": "Worked as the core model developer on a 4-person team for this final year project. My responsibilities include designing, training and optimizing deep learning models to identify Indian cities from user-uploaded images. Trained a deep learning model on a dataset of 10,500 images depicting 5 Indian cities, achieving 66.3% accuracy. Implemented transfer learning using a VGG16 CNN model for feature extraction and deployed it using Flask.",

        "description": "Developed a generative AI system for synthetic structured data generation, from concept to deployment. This involved creating a pipeline with Python and Gradio for data cleaning, deduplication, and embedding, enhancing data quality for generative models. Additionally, I designed a robust training framework using PyTorch and Hugging Faces Transformers, enabling fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse datasets, significantly improving model accuracy and performance. Introduced a user-friendly Gradio interface to streamline synthetic structured data generation, facilitating easy data synthesis for users and enhancing customer interaction with the system. This interface significantly simplified the synthetic structured data generation process for users.",
