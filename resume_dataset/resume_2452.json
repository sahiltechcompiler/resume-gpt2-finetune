The Mini Linux Terminal ensures accurate execution of file operations, achieving a 99.9 percent success rate in file creation, deletion, and modification tasks. This project includes more than 10 commands that mimic essential functions found in the Linux file system. An operating system relies on a structured file system where data is stored in folders and their subfolders. This system typically comprises thousands of directories and subdirectories, providing a hierarchical organization for efficient data storage and retrieval.",
