AMEY SAWANT F u l l S t a c k D e v e l o p e r ABOUT ME Hello, I'm Amey Sawant, a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in the MERN stack, encompassing ReactJS, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js. My expertise is in designing frontend pages that are basic yet attractive and deliver a consistent user experience. But it's the amazing realms of augmented reality and virtual reality that genuinely fascinate me, not my technological skills. I'm confident that these cutting- edge technologies will change the way we connect with the outside world and provide us with a plethora of opportunities to enhance our lives. I have also worked as an intern at CareLink as a Frontend Developer. I am entirely immersed in researching the most recent trends and technologies in the web development market in order to stay ahead of the curve. I'm also interested in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), Gen AI and I'm continually searching for ways to progress these technologies and leverage their potential to serve society. Join me on this journey as we explore the incredible possibilities that lie ahead! +91 7045162003 assawant06@gmail.com amey1355 ameysawant1355 Bandra East, Mumbai EDUCATION PROJECTS 2022 - Present (2025 Expected) B.
