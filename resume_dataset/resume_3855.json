    "summary": "I would describe myself as a very hardworking and determined student, evidenced by the fact that I am a humanities student pursuing Economics Honours in one of the most reputed colleges in India: Delhi University's North Campus. Having an enthusiastic approach toward calculus, I solved many problems well to get good scores. I am an enthusiastic chess player, with an Elo rating above 1800. This proves a comprehensive and unique mindset of solving problems. I have deep knowledge of higher mathematics, logical reasoning, and the management field. The urge to learn in different domains has enabled me to keep enriching my skill sets. Perfection with spoken and written English and Hindi is my forte.",
