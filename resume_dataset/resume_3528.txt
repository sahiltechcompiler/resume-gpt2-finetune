Designed and trained machine learning models using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and OpenCv libraries implementing data preprocessing techniques, evaluating model performance, and fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal results. P R O J E C T S Object Detection on Custom Dataset | [Github] Tech Stack: Python, MatPlotLib, os, Numpy, Ultralytics, YOLOv8, OpenCV Apr 2024- May 2024 Self created a dataset of 60 guitar images downloaded from Google and annotated using MakeSense.ai to detect guitars. Dataset was split into 35 training images and 15 testing images. YOLOv8 was employed for its real-time object detection capabilities, and OpenCV was used for visualizing the results. Trained on 20 epochs, Mean Average Precision (MAP) of 0.79 was achieved. Movie Genre Prediction[Github] Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Spacy,Numpy Aug 2023 This project involves creating a rule-based chatbot using NLTK and TensorFlow to answer college- related queries. It provides accurate information on admissions, courses, facilities, and events. The chatbot uses NLTK for tokenization and lemmatization with WordNetLemmatizer, and TensorFlow enhances its capabilities. Image Captioning using Lstm [Github] Aug 2023 Tech Stack: Python, VGG16, LSTM, TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, MatPlotLib This project involves developing an image caption generator using the Flickr dataset, where VGG16 serves as the encoder and an RNN as the decoder. Trained over 50 epochs, the model achieves an accuracy of 0.65. VGG16 extracts features from the images, which are then utilized by the RNN to generate descriptive captions. Implementing beam search during prediction ensured more accurate descriptions.
