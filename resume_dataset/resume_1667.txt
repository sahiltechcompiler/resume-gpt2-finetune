Addressed the challenge of deciphering speech based solely on visual cues from lip movements and achieved a Word-Error-Rate Accuracy of 90.3%. Ethnicity, Gender & Age Detection Using MobileNetV2 And InceptionNet Leveraged transfer learning with a pre-trained MobileNetV2 and then through InceptionNet for efficient facial at- tribute recognition. The model classifies age, ethnicity, and gender from images, and compares the result through the two models, achieving high accuracy with reduced training time and resources. Other Projects: ImageToCSV Conversion Through Tesseract OCR, Twitter Sentiment Analysis, Facial Emotion Detection using CNNs CERTIFICATIONS  Machine Learning Specialization, DeepLearning.AI & Stanford University, 2024  Neural Networks and Deep Learning, DeepLearning.AI, 2024  Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization, DeepLearning.AI  CCNA: Introduction to Networks , Cisco Networking Academy, 2024  CCNA: Enterprise Networking, Security, and Automation , Cisco Networking Academy, 2024
