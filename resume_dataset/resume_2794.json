Leveraging cutting-edge tools such as Eclipse, Apache Tomcat, and Tortoise SVN, I meticulously crafted and refined the 3D warehouse model. This involved creating dynamic web interfaces that allowed users to interact with and manipulate the warehouse model in real-time. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, I ensured seamless integration of the developed model with project objectives. This hands-on experience not only honed my skills in web development but also provided me with invaluable insights into the practical applications of advanced tools in the electronics industry.",
