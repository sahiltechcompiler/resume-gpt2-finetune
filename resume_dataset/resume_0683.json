Refined particle position calculations with Zarkhov functions; achieved a 35% increase in algorithm efficiency and a 25% reduction in computation time, delivering substantial time savings for the data analysis team. Optimized localized exploration by partitioning the search space and assigning particles to subspaces, resulting in a 40% increase in solution space coverage.",
