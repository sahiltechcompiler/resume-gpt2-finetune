Hello,Sir I'm writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding a transaction involving Rohit Narwal. On March 5, 2024, Rohit Narwal sent me 15,000 rupees. However, as I didn't recognize the sender, I advised him to contact his bank to reverse the transaction. Despite this, he insisted that I return the money. Subsequently, he filed a false complaint, resulting in the reversal of the transaction and the freezing of another account. I have also reached out to the investigating officer regarding this matter, but unfortunately, I haven't received a satisfactory response. I kindly request prompt attention to this issue, as it has been over 3 month, and my funds remain inaccessible. Complaint Number: 21303240011124 Date: 29/03/2024 Location: Haryana Law Enforcement Agency Details: Name: PS Sadar Karnal Designation: Police Inspector Contact Number: 9254047203 Thank you for your assistance. Sincerely
