Implemented BERT embeddings and a BiLSTM architecture to capture contextual information and identify spam-like patterns. Developed a feature-based BiLSTM model incorporating sentiment analysis and other textual features, resulting in a 15% accuracy improvement. Incorporated temporal features to enhance understanding of review dynamics.",
