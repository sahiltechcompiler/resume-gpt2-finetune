Conducted an optimization experiment that analyzed a large amount of data with regard to catchiness of email titles and created a classification model using RandomForest classifier and Support Vector Classifier and experimented with various tokenizers/embeddings like BERT, TF-IDF and EmoroBERT. It can take a custom input for a title and classify how catchy it is.",
