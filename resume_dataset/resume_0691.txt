Researched about machine learning models, deep learning models and suitable applications upon publicly available datasets. Projects Musculo-Skeletal Disease Prediction | 1D-CNN, LSTM, GRU Sept. 2023  Employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models to analyze & forecast MSD occurrences.  Implemented 1D-CNN architecture for feature extraction on sequential data with a model accuracy of 97.19%.  Directed the use of bi-directional LSTM & GRU to enhance the understanding of complex patterns in the data. E-Commerce Website | JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, XAMPP Feb. 2024  Incorporated JavaScript for active content rendering & asynchronous operations, enhancing website interactivity.  Employed PHP to handle server-side processing, such as database interactions and form submissions.  Implemented MySQL for effective database creation, editing & management. Multi-species plant disease prediction | Data visualization, CNN, Augmentation, Optimization Apr. 2024  Prepared a self-extracted large dataset of plant species with disease where each disease having four levels of severity.  Leveraged optimization techniques to improve model accuracy upto 97.05%.
