PARTICIPATED IN VIBA HOBBY PROJECTS. MINI PROJECT  ACCIDENT PREVENTION IN HILL STATIONS. According to a report, 10% of all car collisions in hill stations occur on curving roadways. Driving through curves and bends is dangerous. An IoT-based Accident Prevention System for Hairpin Bend Roads has been offered in this work as a potential option. The answer of this problem is alerting the motive force about the vehicle coming from opposite side. This is often done by keeping the ultrasonic sensor in one side of the road before the curve and keeping a LED light after the curve, so that vehicle comes from one side of curve a senses and LED light glow at opposite side. By viewing the LED light green and red criteria the motive force can become alert and may hamper the speed of vehicle.
